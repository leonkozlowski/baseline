Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, all outstanding ordinary shares of the Company (each, an ""Ordinary Share""), including Ordinary Shares represented by American depositary shares, each representing four Ordinary Shares (""ADSs""), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and ADSs representing Excluded Shares, will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holders thereof to receive $2.45 in cash per Ordinary Share (the ""Per Share Merger Consideration""), or $9.80 in cash per ADS (the ""Per ADS Merger Consideration"").  The Per ADS Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 35.7% to the closing trading price of the ADSs on June 5, 2020, the last trading day prior to the Company's announcement of its receipt of a ""going-private"" proposal from Mr. Zhu, Ms. Yin, and their affiliated entity, and a premium of 37.1% to the volume-weighted average closing price of the ADSs during the last 30 trading days prior to the Company's receipt of the ""going-private"" proposal. The Merger Agreement provides that each outstanding share option (each, a ""Company Option"") to purchase Ordinary Shares, whether vested or unvested, that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, will be cancelled and exchanged for the holder's right to receive, at or promptly after the effectiveness of the Merger, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option by (ii) the number of Ordinary Shares underlying such Company Option.  Each Ordinary Share subject to a Company restricted share award (each, a ""Company Restricted Share Award""), whether vested or unvested, that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, except for the Company Restricted Share Awards held by Mr. Zhu and Ms. Yin, will be cancelled and exchanged for the holder's right to receive, at or promptly after the effectiveness of the Merger, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration.   The Company's board of directors (the ""Board""), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a committee of independent and disinterested directors established by the Board (the ""Special Committee""), approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger and resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders vote to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

Fertiláqua gives ICL a significant foothold in a major market, where demand growth for specialty plant nutrition products is increasing rapidly. In addition, it unlocks immediate synergies for distribution in Brazil and further expands ICL's product portfolio with higher growth, higher margin products, as well as provides balance for seasonality in our specialty fertilizer sales between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.""

"PITTSBURGH, Oct. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --   Key Highlights 
 Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS), the global leader and innovator of engineering simulation software, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), a premier provider of mission-driven simulation, modeling, testing and analysis software for aerospace, defense and intelligence applications. Once closed, the acquisition will expand the scope of Ansys' solution offering, empowering users to solve challenges by simulating from the chip now all the way to a customers' entire mission – like tracking an orbiting satellite and its periodic connection to ground stations. The purchase price for the transaction is $700 million, of which 67% of the consideration will be paid in cash and 33% will be paid through the issuance of Ansys common stock. In conjunction with the transaction, Ansys anticipates obtaining new debt financing to fund a significant portion of the cash component of the purchase price. AGI has pioneered digital mission engineering, a key component of digital transformation. Once closed, the acquisition of AGI will expand Ansys' simulation footprint into customers' missions, an area of simulation beyond the traditional component or product level. Missions are typically higher-level endeavors that support space, telecommunications, national defense and search-and-rescue initiatives. Mission-driven simulation, integrated with systems engineering, enables organizations to provide the best configuration to achieve various desired mission objectives.  Digital mission engineering empowers organizations to evaluate then optimize the performance of engineered systems across the overall mission. It also helps them effectively respond to evolving mission objectives, which often change during the course of a system's lifecycle. As a result, these missions are more likely to succeed, saving the customer time, money and other crucial resources. As an example, experts project that more than 10,000 satellites will be launched into orbit in the next five years. AGI's software will help its customers design, launch, and safely operate the next generation of satellite constellations which are critical for navigation, earth imagery, weather and communications. AGI's software models and simulates many important elements, such as a satellite's orbital mechanics, enabling users to design, operate or use space systems with improved efficiency and effectiveness. Based in Exton, Pa., AGI has a 30-year track record of success across industries, with hundreds of customers around the world, particularly in the government and federal aerospace and defense industries. As an existing Ansys partner, AGI's technology already connects into the Ansys simulation portfolio. Once closed, AGI's strong customer relationships will help Ansys reach new aerospace and defense customers while the Ansys sales channel can drive mission-based simulation to its broader existing installed base.  ""Ansys' acquisition of AGI will help drive our strategy of making simulation pervasive from the smallest component now through a customer's entire mission,"" said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys. ""It will also expand the use of simulation in the key aerospace sector, where the stakes can be at their highest levels. We are excited to welcome the expert AGI team – and to expand the reach of their world-class technology to industries outside of aerospace, including for autonomy and 5G applications.""  ""In the three decades since our founding, we have continuously invested in our technology to create and advance digital mission engineering,"" said Paul Graziani, CEO and co-founder of AGI. ""We are thrilled to become part of Ansys so we can dramatically extend the reach of our world-class products and help more customers accomplish their critical missions.""  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to receipt of regulatory clearance and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is not expected to have a meaningful impact on the 2020 non-GAAP results. Ansys expects that the transaction will add $75 million to $85 million of non-GAAP revenue to its 2021 results and will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP projections exclude the effects of acquisition adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and transaction costs related to the acquisition. The corresponding GAAP revenue and diluted earnings per share measures are not estimable on a forward-looking basis at this time, as such measures require a fair valuation to be performed on the net assets purchased, which will be completed subsequent to the closing.

"JINJIANG, China, Sept. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- China Ceramics Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ Capital Market: CCCL) (""China Ceramics"" or the ""Company""), a leading Chinese manufacturer of ceramic tiles used for exterior siding and for interior flooring and design in residential and commercial buildings, today announced that its Board of Directors has set the date of September 3, 2020 to be the effective date for the Company's reverse stock split.  The Company's ordinary shares will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on September 3, 2020. The new CUSIP number for the Company's common stock following the reverse split is G2113X159. The Company's Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split so as to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market. In order to maintain the Company's listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company's common stock must have a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days by September 21, 2020. There can be no assurance that following the reverse split, the Company's common stock will remain above $1.00 per share minimum for the requisite period as of September 21, 2020 to regain listing compliance. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, its securities may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market which, in turn, will result in significant adverse effect on the value and liquidity of the Company's securities. As a result of the reverse stock split, every three issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of the effective date will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share. Consequently, the reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding ordinary shares of the Company from approximately 9.2 million shares to approximately 3.1 million shares, and the par value per share will increase from $0.008 to $0.024. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company will issue one full share of the post-reverse stock split common share to any stockholder who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share. All outstanding stock options, warrants and other rights to purchase the Company's ordinary shares will be adjusted proportionately as a result of the reverse stock split.  Once the reverse stock split becomes effective, shareholders holding shares through a bank, broker or other nominee will have their shares automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.  Beneficial holders may contact their bank, broker or nominee for more information.  Shareholders holding physical certificates of ordinary shares will receive a letter of transmittal from the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust, with specific instructions regarding the exchange of shares. Please direct any questions to your broker or the Company's Transfer Agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust, by calling 212-509-4000. About China Ceramics Co., Ltd.

"CLEVELAND, Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cobham Aero Connectivity (""CAC"" or ""the Company"") for approximately $965 million in cash, including tax benefits.   Additionally, TransDigm provided an update with regard to its previously announced plans to potentially divest a select number of defense-oriented operating units that were acquired as part of the Esterline acquisition. Acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity (""CAC"") Cobham Aero Connectivity is headquartered in Marlow, UK.  The Company is a leading provider of highly engineered antennas and radios for the aerospace end market. The products are primarily proprietary with significant aftermarket content and have a strong presence across major defense platforms as well as select commercial applications.  The Company is expected to generate approximately $225 million in revenue in 2020.  Nearly 60% of CAC's revenue is derived from international sales, and the Company has a strong presence across a diverse range of both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.  The Company operates from two primary facilities in Marlow, UK and Prescott, Arizona.  CAC employs approximately 760 people. The acquisition, which is expected to close during the first calendar quarter of 2021, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.  The acquisition is expected to be financed through existing cash on hand. Potential Divestitures of Former Esterline Operating Units The operating units under consideration for potential divestiture were acquired by TransDigm in March 2019 as part of the Esterline Technologies acquisition. Since the acquisition, these businesses have functioned as independent operating units under TransDigm's ownership. These operating units primarily serve the defense end market and have combined annual revenue of $250 to $300 million.  TransDigm is now working with outside advisors to assist in the process of identifying and approaching potential buyers.  At this time, the timeline for any announced divestitures remains uncertain. W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm's Executive Chairman, stated, ""We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity. This business fits well with our long-standing strategy. The CAC products are almost all proprietary and over 70% of CAC's revenue comes from the aftermarket. The Company is primarily a defense business. The businesses we are considering for divestiture are also good businesses, but do not fit as well with our long-standing proprietary and aftermarket strategy."" Kevin Stein, TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, added, ""We are excited about the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity.  The Company has established positions across a diverse range of new and existing aircraft platforms.  Major customers include Airbus, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies, AgustaWestland/Leonardo and Elbit. We also see significant opportunity for ongoing upgrade and retrofit activity as the demand for faster and more data intensive communication continues. As with all TransDigm acquisitions, we expect the CAC acquisition to create equity value in-line with our long-term private equity-like return objectives."" About TransDigm TransDigm Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today.

"Landmark deal by global, cloud commerce leader grows Lightspeed's U.S. footprint by more than 20,000 customer locations following listing on the New York Stock Exchange  MONTREAL, Nov. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Lightspeed POS Inc. (NYSE: LSPD) (TSX: LSPD), a leading provider of cloud-based, omnichannel commerce platforms, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ShopKeep Inc. (ShopKeep), a leading cloud commerce platform provider based in New York City. This acquisition reinforces Lightspeed's status as a clear category leader for complex retailers and restaurateurs seeking to modernize their operations as the global economy undergoes unprecedented digital acceleration.  COVID-19 is forcing independent businesses to urgently replace legacy point-of-sale systems in order to remain operational and safely adapt to evolving consumer behaviors. The scale achieved by the combination of Lightspeed and ShopKeep presents retail and restaurant business owners in the United States with enhanced resources to pivot their operations. Lightspeed's analytics, loyalty, eCommerce, and payments modules, in addition to its multi-location solution, will offer ShopKeep's customer base the opportunity to enhance their capabilities. The acquisition immediately expands Lightspeed's U.S. market share, allowing for increased investment in sales, marketing, and research and development to capitalize on the increasing demand for modern, cloud-based, omnichannel commerce solutions. Following the closing of the acquisition, Lightspeed will serve over 100,000 customer locations1 worldwide, generating approximately $33 billion USD in gross transaction volume2 (GTV). ""ShopKeep's commitment to enabling independent businesses to dream big and rise above industry and economic challenges is deeply aligned with our own mission to power the future of commerce,"" said Dax Dasilva, Founder and CEO of Lightspeed. ""This acquisition will bring ShopKeep merchants, small and medium-sized businesses that make up the backbone of the U.S economy, into the Lightspeed family, providing them even more crucial product innovation and world-class support as they drive the reinvention of American commerce.""  The acquisition will generate strong expected synergies resulting from increased GTV, the ability to leverage integrated go-to-market resources and a combined payments opportunity. Once closed, Lightspeed's acquisition of ShopKeep will follow the successful integration of multiple premier platforms that experienced accelerated growth following their acquisitions by Lightspeed, including that of Montréal-based Chronogolf, Sydney-based Kounta and Berlin-based Gastrofix.  ""We believe uniting with Lightspeed highlights and amplifies our shared vision to deliver industry leading commerce enablement for small and medium-sized businesses,"" said Michael DeSimone, CEO of ShopKeep. ""Our partnership sets the stage to help business owners navigate through challenging times, keep pace with rapid change and adapt quickly to meet the rising demands of today's customers."" Details of transaction: ShopKeep generated revenue of approximately $50 million3 and GTV of approximately $7 billion in the trailing twelve month period ending September 2020. Lightspeed will acquire ShopKeep for a total estimated consideration of approximately $440 million, satisfied by way of payment on closing of $145.2 million in cash and the issuance of 9,500,000 subordinate voting shares in the capital of Lightspeed, subject to the adjustment mechanisms outlined in footnote 4 below.4 The deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions and post-closing working capital adjustment, is expected to close before the end of the company's quarter ending December 31, 2020.  Additional details regarding this transaction will be communicated during Lightspeed's Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call, which is scheduled for Thursday, November 5, 2020.

The action will take effect at the open of trading on Thursday, July 30, 2020.

The reverse stock split is being implemented with the goals of increasing the per-share trading price to ultimately reach the $4.00 regular bid price required by Nasdaq, and improving the marketability and liquidity of the common stock.  ""This reverse split will help GRWC normalize trading and better align with our business activity,"" said interim CEO Terry Kennedy.

"IRVINE, Calif., July 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTC: BKFG) today announced that it has filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-10,000, followed immediately by the filing of a second Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a forward stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, at a ratio of 10,000-for-1.  The effective time of the reverse stock split was 6:00 p.m. ET on July 16, 2020, and the effective time of the forward stock split was 6:01 p.m. ET on July 16, 2020.   As a result of the reverse split, every 10,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of BKF Capital Group was automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock.  Any shares of common stock that would be converted into less than one share in the reverse split were instead converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to $9.50 per share of common stock held before the reverse split.  However, if a stockholder held at least 10,000 shares of common stock in his or her account at the effective time of the reverse split, any fractional share in such account resulting from the Reverse Split was not cashed out, but instead was automatically split and converted into 10,000 issued and outstanding share of common stock, so that the total number of shares held by these stockholders before the reverse split did not change as a result of the stock splits. The stock splits were approved by BKF Capital Group's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on July 16, 2020. BKF Capital Group has chosen its transfer agent, Equiniti, to act as the paying agent to manage the process by which stockholders who owned less than one share of common stock immediately following the reverse split will receive cash for their fractional shares.

"DULUTH, Ga., July 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: ABG), one of the largest automotive retail and service companies in the U.S., entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Park Place Dealerships, one of the country's largest and most prominent luxury dealer groups for $685 million of goodwill and approximately $50 million for parts, fixed assets, and leaseholds, excluding vehicle inventory. ""We are pleased our business model and performance allowed us to navigate the current environment and re-engage on a highly strategic acquisition that will make us an even stronger company. We have seen our new and used volume sequentially improve each week in May and June with higher profit per vehicle.  We have also seen our Parts and Service business improve in June as the economy gradually opens-up.  Strong May and June performance, along with cost restructuring efforts, have driven higher profitability and cash flow, giving us conviction to move forward with a revised Park Place acquisition. In March, we had to step away from the transaction due to lack of visibility around COVID-19, but after seeing the rebound off the April low, we can proceed with a more refined deal under more flexible and favorable terms"" said David Hult, Asbury's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Park Place is highly regarded as one of the best and most efficient operators of luxury stores in the industry.  Their portfolio of stores comes with a strong base of loyal clients and long-tenured team members throughout the high growth Dallas/Fort Worth market.  This acquisition will enhance our total portfolio and add approximately $1.7 billion in expected annualized revenues. We are thankful to all of our employees who have worked so hard over the last few months to manage through this pandemic. The talent in our organization and the resilience of the dealer model have put us in a position to acquire Park Place and become a more diversified company,"" Hult added. The operating assets to be acquired include 12 new vehicle franchises, all of which are located in the attractive Dallas/Fort Worth market: 3 Mercedes-Benz, 3 Sprinter, 2 Lexus, 1 Jaguar and 1 Land Rover, 1 Porsche, and 1 Volvo. The acquisition will also include the Park Place auto auction and two collision centers. The transaction is expected to increase Asbury's geographic mix to 28% of revenue derived from the Texas market, and further diversify the Company's overall portfolio from 36% to approximately 49% of revenue derived from luxury brands. The luxury segment has historically delivered strong and stable margins that are significantly above those achieved by mid-line import and domestic brands.  Luxury stores also tend to be more resilient in downturns, operate fewer dealers nation-wide and maintain a higher portion of gross profit from parts and service.   Park Place has a highly attractive mix of large dealerships with revenue comprised of 38% Mercedes-Benz, 37% Lexus, 12% Jaguar/Land Rover, 9% Porsche, and 5% Volvo.   Park Place owns and operates a portfolio of high volume, award winning luxury dealerships with premier real estate. Four stores are ranked among the top 10 stores in volume in the country amongst their franchise: Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Porsche, and the Jaguar/Land Rover store. In addition, the other Lexus store and the Volvo store are ranked in the top 20 nationally. Financial Impact The purchase price includes $685 million of goodwill and approximately $50 million for parts, fixed assets, and leaseholds, excluding vehicle inventory.  The transaction is targeted to close in the third quarter of 2020. It is subject to customary closing conditions.  The Company expects to achieve significant synergies over the next three years through integrating Park Place with Asbury. The purchase price reflects a 7.7x multiple on targeted EBITDA of $95 million, including run-rate synergies of at least $20 million, expected to be realized over the next three years. In addition, Asbury is expecting $10 million in annual cash tax savings from goodwill amortization with a present value of approximately $80 million. In all, the Company believes the returns on the Park Place investment will exceed its cost of capital and will deliver substantial value to shareholders. The acquisition of Park Place, assuming an end of August close, is expected to be accretive to 2021 earnings.  Asbury also expects to incur pre-tax costs associated with the transaction of approximately $0.20 per share in Q3 2020.

The Park Place transaction is expected to be funded through a combination of Asbury's existing credit facilities, seller financing, and cash on hand.  Although the transaction is expected to initially take the Company above its targeted leverage range, the strength of the business combined with free cash flow generation is expected to allow the Company to maintain a strong credit profile and deleverage to 3.0x within eighteen months.

"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Aberdeen Standard Global Infrastructure Income Fund (NYSE: ASGI) (the ""Fund""), a closed-end fund, today announced that it paid on November 10, 2020, a distribution of US $0.1083 per share to all shareholders of record as of November 3, 2020 (ex-dividend date November 2, 2020). As announced on August 31, 2020, the Fund will pay a fixed monthly distribution at an annualized rate of 6.5% on the initial public offering price of $20.00 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021. Your Fund's distribution policy is to provide investors with a stable monthly distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital.  Under U.S. tax rules applicable to the Fund, the amount and character of distributable income for each fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act"") and related Rules, the Fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the Rules adopted thereunder. The table has been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles.  The table includes estimated amounts and percentages for this distribution relating to fiscal year to date (10/01/2020 - 11/10/2020), from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated composition of the distributions may vary from month to month because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies. Estimated Amounts of Current Monthly Distribution per share ($) Estimated Amounts of Current Monthly Distribution per share (%) Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year to Date Cumulative Distributions per share ($) Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year to Date Cumulative Distributions per share (%) Net Investment Income $0.0173 16% $0.0347 16% Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains* $0.0271 25% $0.0542 25% Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains  - - - - Return of Capital  $0.0639 59% $0.1277 59% Total (per common share)  $0.1083 100% $0.2166 100% *includes currency gains The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" As of October 20, 2020, after giving effect to this payment, the Fund estimates it has a net deficit of $687,000. A net deficit results when the Fund has net unrealized losses that are in excess of any net realized gains that have not yet been distributed. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the ""Distribution Policy""). The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2020 will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The following table provides information regarding the Fund's total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Fund's annualized and cumulative distribution rates. Average Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5 Year Period Ended 10/31/20201,2 (4.25%) Annualized Distribution Rate on NAV as of the Fiscal Period Ended 10/31/20203 6.83% Fiscal Year to Date (09/30/2020 to 10/31/2020) Cumulative Total Return on NAV1 (1.44%) Cumulative Distribution Rate on NAV2 0.57% 1 Return data is net of all Fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.2 The Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July 29, 2020) through October 31, 2020.3 Based on the Fund's NAV as of October 31, 2020. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market. Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2010, the Fund may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Fund during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Fund, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the terms of the distribution policy. The final determination of the source of all distributions will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.  The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. The Fund's Board of Directors has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.

"PITTSBURGH, Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE: DKS), the largest U.S. based full-line omni-channel sporting goods retailer, today reported sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2020.  Third Quarter Results The Company reported consolidated net income for the third quarter ended October 31, 2020 of $177.2 million, or $1.84 per diluted share. As a result of actions taken to prioritize the health and well-being of its teammates and athletes, the Company incurred approximately $48 million of pre-tax incremental teammate compensation and safety costs in response to COVID-19, or $0.37 per diluted share, net of tax, during the current quarter. The Company reported consolidated net income for the third quarter ended November 2, 2019 of $57.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended October 31, 2020 of $182.2 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, which excluded non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Company's convertible senior notes and included the share impact of the convertible note hedge purchased by the Company, which is antidilutive for GAAP purposes. For the third quarter ended November 2, 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income on a non-GAAP basis of $44.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. Third quarter 2019 results exclude the gain on sale of subsidiaries, charges related to the exit of eight Field & Stream stores, and a non-cash asset impairment. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are included in a table later in the release under the heading ""GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations."" Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $2.41 billion, an increase of 22.9% compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by a 23.2% increase in consolidated same store sales and included an increase in eCommerce sales of 95%. eCommerce penetration for the third quarter of 2020 was approximately 21% of total net sales, compared to approximately 13% during the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter 2019 consolidated same store sales increased 6.0%.  ""We had another exceptionally strong quarter from both a sales and a profitability perspective. The strength of our diverse category portfolio once again helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand, as the positive trends across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle continued throughout Q3,"" said Edward W. Stack, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our performance in the quarter was driven by our 45,000 dedicated teammates who continued to work hard every day to safely serve our athletes and communities.""  Lauren R. Hobart, President, added, ""Our stores continue to be the hub of our industry-leading omni-channel platform and were the key to our unprecedented third quarter growth. Brick-and-mortar store comps grew double-digits, and our stores fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales, which increased nearly 100% for the quarter. In fact, our stores drove 90% of our total Q3 sales growth, whether an athlete purchased at the register, picked up curbside or had their order delivered through ship-from-store. Data science and technology will continue to play an important role in creating a personalized, one-to-one relationship with our athletes, enabling us to serve them in the most convenient way possible."" Mr. Stack concluded, ""Overall, the favorable trends in our business have continued into Q4. These strong sales results have been partially offset by warmer weather that has negatively impacted sales in important cold-weather categories. Taken together, through the first three weeks of Q4, our consolidated comp sales have increased in the high-teens."" Balance Sheet The Company ended the third quarter of 2020 with nearly $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under its $1.855 billion revolving credit facility. In April, the Company issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes, which added over $500 million of net proceeds to its cash position. Total inventory decreased 9.8% at the end of the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-Date Results The Company reported consolidated net income for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 of $310.6 million, or $3.44 per diluted share. As a result of actions taken to prioritize the health and well-being of its teammates and athletes in response to COVID-19, the Company incurred approximately $124 million of pre-tax incremental teammate compensation and safety costs, or $1.01 per diluted share, net of tax, during the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020. For the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income of $227.6 million, or $2.53 per diluted share.  On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported consolidated net income for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 of $321.3 million, or $3.65 per diluted share, which excluded non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Company's convertible senior notes and included the share impact of the convertible note hedge purchased by the Company, which is antidilutive for GAAP purposes. For the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income on a non-GAAP basis of $215.8 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, which excludes the gain on sale of subsidiaries, non-cash asset impairments, charges related to the exit of eight Field & Stream stores, and the favorable settlement of a litigation contingency. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are included in a table later in the release under the heading ""GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations."" Net sales for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 increased 5.2% to approximately $6.46 billion. Despite temporary store closures during March, April and May to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, consolidated same store sales increased 5.8%. eCommerce sales increased 135%. eCommerce penetration for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 was approximately 28% of total net sales, compared to approximately 13% during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019. Consolidated same store sales increased 3.1% for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019. Capital Allocation On November 20, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.3125 per share on the Company's Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

Full Year 2020 Outlook As previously announced on March 19, 2020, the Company withdrew its fiscal 2020 outlook. The Company is not providing an updated outlook at this time. Conference Call Info The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter results. Investors will have the opportunity to listen to the earnings conference call over the internet through the Company's website located at investors.DICKS.com. To listen to the live call, please go to the website at least fifteen minutes early to register, download, and install any necessary audio software. For those who cannot listen to the live webcast, it will be archived on the Company's website for approximately twelve months. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting the Company's financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, and net capital expenditures, which management believes provides investors with useful supplemental information to evaluate the Company's ongoing operations and to compare with past and future periods. Management believes that excluding non-cash debt discount amortization from its convertible senior notes and including the share impact from the convertible note hedge is useful to investors because it provides a more complete view of the economics of the transaction. Management also uses certain non-GAAP measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, and measuring its operating performance. These measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below and on the Company's website at investors.DICKS.com. Fiscal 2020 Consolidated Same Store Sales Consolidated same store sales include stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating consolidated same store sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculating this metric may not be the same as other retailers' methods. For additional information on consolidated same store sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward-looking statements normally contain words like ""believe"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""intend"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""may"", ""will"", ""should"", ""strategy"", ""future"" and similar expressions. By their nature, forward looking statements require the Corporation to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Corporation's business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that the Corporation believes are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. Important risks that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic such as health and safety, reduction and suspension of operations, global economic conditions, diversions of management attention, heightened IT risks, liquidity risks and credit risks, risks relating to the industry such as competition, business development and awarding of new contracts, level and timing of defence spending, government-funded defence and security programs, constraints within the civil aviation industry, regulatory matters, natural or other disasters, environmental laws and regulations, climate change, risks relating to CAE such as evolving standards and technology innovation, the Corporation's ability to penetrate new markets, R&D activities, fixed-price and long term supply contracts, strategic partnerships and long-term contracts, procurement and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) leverage, product integration and program management, protection of the Corporation's intellectual property and brand, third-party intellectual property, loss of key personnel, labour relations, liability risks that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance, warranty or other product-related claims, integration of acquired businesses through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or divestitures, reputational risk, U.S. foreign ownership, control or influence mitigation measures, length of sales cycle, seasonality, continued returns to shareholders, information technology and cybersecurity, the Corporation's reliance on technology and third party providers, data privacy, and risks relating to the market such as foreign exchange, availability of capital, credit risk, pension plan funding, doing business in foreign countries, geopolitical uncertainty, anti-corruption laws and taxation matters.

More information about the risks and uncertainties affecting CAE's business can be found in the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2020 and the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Any one or more of the factors described above and elsewhere in this press release, and in the documents referenced herein, may be exacerbated by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and may have a more negative impact on CAE's business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on CAE's forward-looking statements. Readers are also cautioned that the risks described above and elsewhere in this press release, and in the documents referenced herein, are not necessarily the only ones the Corporation faces; additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to the Corporation or that the Corporation may currently deem immaterial may adversely affect CAE's business. Except as required by law, the Corporation disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Material AssumptionsThe forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the anticipated negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the intended effect of mitigation measures implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CAE's available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on CAE's revolving credit facilities, the balance available under CAE's receivable purchase program, CAE's cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future; and no material financial, operational or competitive consequences of changes in regulations affecting CAE's business. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2020 and the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Given the impact of the changing circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the related response from CAE, governments, regulatory authorities, businesses and customers, there is inherently more uncertainty associated with CAE's assumptions. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this press release, and in the documents referenced herein, and, consequently, the forward-looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate.

"MONTREAL, Oct. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (Turquoise Hill or the Company) announced today that it is proceeding with the planned consolidation (or reverse stock-split) of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares at a ratio of one post-consolidation share for every ten pre-consolidation shares (the Consolidation). The Consolidation will be effective as of October 23, 2020. Notice has been provided to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and conditional approval to proceed with the Consolidation has been received from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Subject to the receipt of all required and final approvals, the Company's common shares are expected to begin trading on the NYSE and the TSX, on a consolidated basis, on or about October 26, 2020.  The Company's shareholders approved a special resolution at the Company's annual and special meeting of shareholders held on July 24, 2020, granting the board of directors authority, in its sole discretion, to implement the Consolidation and to select the exact consolidation ratio, provided that (i) the ratio be no smaller than one post-consolidation share for every five pre-consolidation shares and no larger than one post-consolidation share for every thirty pre-consolidation shares, and (ii) the number of pre-consolidation shares in the ratio be a whole number of common shares. The principal reason for implementing the Consolidation is to ensure that the Company's common shares remain eligible for continued listing on the NYSE. The NYSE's listing rules require that a listed security must have an average closing price of at least US$1.00 over a 30- day trading period in order to remain eligible for continued listing on the exchange. The Consolidation will reduce the number of issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from 2,012,314,469 shares to approximately 201,231,446 shares. Turquoise Hill's common shares will continue to trade on the NYSE and the TSX under the existing ticker symbols. Following the Consolidation, the new CUSIP number for the Company's common shares will be 900435207 and the new ISIN will be CA9004352071.  Proportionate adjustments will be made to the Company's outstanding performance share units, restricted share units and deferred share units. No fractional Common Shares will be issued pursuant to the Consolidation. Any and all such fractional shares will be aggregated and sold by the Company's transfer agent and registrar, AST Trust Company (Canada) (AST), on the market and in the event that the proceeds therefrom, net of brokerage commissions, expenses and withholding taxes, exceed US$5.00, such proceeds shall be paid to the relevant shareholders in proportion to their fractional entitlements. The Company is only responsible for dealing with fractions arising on registered holdings. For shareholders who hold their common shares through an intermediary (such as a securities broker, dealer, bank or other financial institution), the effect of the Consolidation on their individual holdings will be administered by the intermediary. Further details on the Consolidation are contained in the amended management information circular of the Company dated June 17, 2020, which has been filed and is available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.  AST will act as the exchange agent for the Consolidation. While a letter of transmittal was previously mailed to the Company's registered shareholders along with its proxy materials in March of 2020, a new letter of transmittal will be mailed to the Company's registered shareholders in respect of the Consolidation.  Registered shareholders will be required to send their certificate(s) representing pre-Consolidation common shares of the Company, along with a properly executed letter of transmittal, to AST in accordance with the instructions provided in the letter of transmittal. Shareholders who previously returned their certificates to AST with a properly executed letter of transmittal will not be required to take any further action with respect to the Consolidation. Shareholders who hold their common shares through a securities broker, dealer, bank or other financial institution will not be required to take any action with respect to the Consolidation and should contact that intermediary for their post-Consolidation positions. A copy of the new letter of transmittal will be available on the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and will also be posted on the Company's website at www.turquoisehill.com.

Forward-looking statements and information are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements or information. There can be no assurance that such statements or information will prove to be accurate. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies, local and global economic conditions, and the environment in which the Company will operate in the future, including the price of copper, gold and silver; projected gold, copper and silver grades; anticipated capital and operating costs, anticipated future production and cash flows; the anticipated location of certain infrastructure in Hugo North Lift 1; sequence of mining within and across panel boundaries; the availability and timing of required governmental and other approvals for the construction of the SOPP; the ability of the Government of Mongolia to finance and procure the SOPP within the timeframes anticipated in the PSFA, as amended; the willingness of third parties to extend existing power arrangements; the status of the Company's relationship and interaction with the Government of Mongolia on the continued operation and development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine and Oyu Tolgoi LLC internal governance; the status and nature of the Company's ongoing discussions with Rio Tinto plc and its subsidiaries with respect to future funding plans and requirements (including as contemplated by the MoU) as well as the completion and potential benefits of the Consolidation, the timing and anticipated effective date of the Consolidation and the date on which the common shares are expected to start trading on the NYSE and the TSX on a consolidated basis. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and information include, among others: copper, gold and silver price volatility; discrepancies between actual and estimated production; mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries; development plans for processing resources; the outcome of the Definitive Estimate review; public health crises such as COVID-19; matters relating to proposed exploration or expansion; mining operational and development risks, including geotechnical risks and ground conditions; litigation risks; regulatory restrictions (including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability); Oyu Tolgoi LLC or the Government of Mongolia's ability to deliver a domestic power source for the Oyu Tolgoi project within the required contractual time frame; communications with local stakeholders and community relations; activities, actions or assessments, including tax assessments, by governmental authorities; events or circumstances (including strikes, blockades or similar events outside of the Company's control) that may affect the Company's ability to deliver its products in a timely manner; currency fluctuations; the speculative nature of mineral exploration; the global economic climate; dilution; share price volatility; competition; loss of key employees; cyber security incidents; additional funding requirements, including in respect of the development or construction of a long-term domestic power supply for the Oyu Tolgoi project; capital and operating costs, including with respect to the development of additional deposits and processing facilities; and defective title to mineral claims or property. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. All such forward-looking statements and information are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company's management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. These statements, however, are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements or information.  With respect to forward-looking information concerning the continued operation and development of Oyu Tolgoi, the Company has based its assumptions and analyses on certain factors which are inherently uncertain. Uncertainties and assumptions include, among others: the timing and cost of the construction and expansion of mining and processing facilities; the timing and availability of a long-term domestic power source (or the availability of financing for the Company or the Government of Mongolia to construct such a source) for Oyu Tolgoi; the ability to secure and draw down on the supplemental debt under the Oyu Tolgoi project financing facility and the availability of additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to Oyu Tolgoi LLC, Rio Tinto and the Company to further develop Oyu Tolgoi as well as the status and nature of the Company's ongoing discussions with Rio Tinto plc and its subsidiaries with respect to future funding plans and requirements (including as contemplated by the MoU); the potential impact of COVID-19; the impact of changes in, changes in interpretation to or changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and government practices in Mongolia; the availability and cost of skilled labour and transportation; the obtaining of (and the terms and timing of obtaining) necessary environmental and other government approvals, consents and permits; delays, and the costs which would result from delays, in the development of the underground mine (which could significantly exceed the costs projected in OTTR20); projected copper, gold and silver prices and their market demand; and production estimates and the anticipated yearly production of copper, gold and silver at Oyu Tolgoi.  The cost, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of a property such as Oyu Tolgoi. It is common in mining operations and in the development or expansion of existing facilities to experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Additionally, although Oyu Tolgoi has achieved commercial production, there is no assurance that future development activities will result in profitable mining operations.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information or statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which contribute to the possibility that the predicted outcomes will not occur. Events or circumstances could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are included in the ""Risk Factors"" section in Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""AIF""), as supplemented by the ""Risks and Uncertainties"" section of the Company's second quarter 2020 management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") dated July 28, 2020. Readers are further cautioned that the list of factors enumerated in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the AIF and in the ""Risks and Uncertainties"" section of the Company's second quarter 2020 MD&A that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on the Company's forward-looking statements and information to make decisions with respect to the Company, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements and information contained herein are made as of the date of this document and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

"SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Expanse Inc., a leader in attack surface management. Under the terms of the agreement, Palo Alto Networks will acquire Expanse for a total purchase price of approximately $670 million to be paid in cash and stock and approximately $130 million in replacement equity awards, each such amount subject to adjustment. The proposed acquisition is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks fiscal second quarter, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. As companies embark on digital transformation, they often leave critical IT assets exposed to the internet, creating vulnerable points that attackers can exploit. This exposure has only accelerated with the rapid shift to the cloud and remote working.  Expanse's internet collection and attribution platform constantly monitors the global internet to map exposed and untracked assets that comprise customers' attack surfaces, evaluate and prioritize risk, and provide mitigation.

Separately, the Fund declared a special year-end distribution of $0.012 per share. The distributions are subject to the following ex-dividend, record and payment dates set by the Fund's Board of Trustees. December 2020 Declaration Tuesday, Dec. 1, 2020 Ex-Dividend Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2020 Record Thursday, Dec. 17, 2020 Payment Thursday, Dec. 31, 2020  This press release is not for tax reporting purposes. The press release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. For information on whether the distribution includes a return of capital, please contact us on or after the distribution payment date. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2021, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return. About DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek high current income; its secondary objective is to seek capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. DoubleLine Capital LP (""DoubleLine""), the Fund's investment adviser, expects that the Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets. The Fund may invest in mortgage-backed securities of any kind and may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as ""high yield"" securities or ""junk bonds""). There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss.

Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Investors should note that the Fund only can be obtained through a broker. This document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted. Fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with investment in the fund. Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a great risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decisions-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks.

"SAN DIEGO, July 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Biocept, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIOC), a leading commercial provider of molecular technologies designed to provide physicians with clinically actionable information to improve the outcomes of patients with cancer, announces that Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis) both have recommended that stockholders vote in favor of Biocept's proxy proposal to authorize a reverse stock split of Biocept's common stock, as further described in Biocept's Proxy Statement for its 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This item is Proposal 4 on the Biocept's proxy card (the ""Proposal""). ISS and Glass Lewis are two leading independent, third-party proxy advisory firms that, among other services, provide proxy voting recommendations to pension funds, investment managers, mutual funds and other institutional shareholders. Biocept's board of directors has recommended a vote FOR the Proposal, which will authorize Biocept's board of directors to amend Biocept's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of Biocept's common stock at a ratio in the range of 1:5 to 1:30, as determined by Biocept's board of directors. The reverse stock split proposal is intended to increase the per-share trading price of Biocept's common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq. Biocept's board believes that maintaining Biocept's Nasdaq listing may provide a broader market for Biocept's common stock than if Biocept's common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, and could help in generating interest in Biocept among investors. Biocept has until December 7, 2020 to satisfy the Nasdaq $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement. If Biocept has not regained compliance with the closing bid price requirement by that time, its common stock will be subject to delisting from Nasdaq.   Voting on the Proposal will be open through the conclusion of Biocept's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will reconvene on July 31, 2020 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. Biocept stockholders as of April 20, 2020, the record date for the Annual Meeting, are invited to attend the reconvened virtual Annual Meeting by registering at https://www.proxydocs.com/branding/964314/edocs/2020/issuer/. The deadline to register is July 29, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.

"HOPKINTON, Mass., Nov. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Please replace the release dated November 19, 2020 with the following corrected version due to revisions to the headline. The corrected release reads: HOPKINTON, MA, Nov. 19, 2020 – Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBPH) (""Spring Bank""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for oncology and inflammatory diseases, announced that at its special meeting of stockholders held earlier today, Spring Bank's stockholders approved the issuance of shares of Spring Bank common stock to holders of share capital of F-star Therapeutics Limited (""F-star"") in connection with its proposed combination with F-star (the ""Exchange"").  In connection with the Exchange, stockholders also approved a proposal to effect a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of Spring Bank common stock at a reverse stock split ratio as mutually agreed to be Spring Bank and F-star in the range of one new share for every three to seven shares outstanding (or any number in between).   Spring Bank and F-star have agreed that the exchange ratio for the reverse stock split will be one for every four shares of Spring Bank common stock outstanding (the ""Reverse Stock Split"").  The Reverse Stock Split will be effective for trading purposes as of the commencement of trading on Monday, November 23, 2020.  At the special meeting, Spring Bank stockholders also approved a change of the corporate name of Spring Bank from ""Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc."" to ""F-star Therapeutics, Inc."" effective upon closing of the Exchange.  It is anticipated that the closing of the Exchange will occur on November 20, 2020. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Spring Bank's common stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be reduced into a smaller number of shares, such that every 4 shares of Spring Bank's common stock held by a stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be combined and reclassified into one share of Spring Bank's common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of pre-split shares not evenly divisible by the number of pre-split shares for which each post-split share is to be reclassified, will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the product of such fraction to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the closing price of Spring Bank's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the last trading day prior to the Reverse Stock Split effective time (as adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split), rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the total number of authorized shares of Spring Bank common stock.

These statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition, or otherwise, based on current beliefs of the management of Spring Bank or F-star as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management of Spring Bank and F-star. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- PREIT (NYSE: PEI), a leading operator of diverse retail and experiential destinations, today announced that it has reached an agreement with more than 80% of its bank lenders under which the banks would provide an additional $150 million to recapitalize the business and extend the Company's debt maturity schedule, supporting PREIT's operations and the continued execution of its strategic priorities.  ""Long before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we began taking meaningful actions to enhance the financial and operational health of the business,"" said Joseph F. Coradino, CEO of PREIT.  ""These steps have included proactive asset sales, anchor repositioning and redevelopment to significantly minimize our exposure to underperforming assets, as well as, diversifying our tenant base to provide mass-market offerings appealing to shoppers while simultaneously improving the Company's underlying tenant credit profile. The next phase in our evolution is continuing on the path we have charted to create diverse multi-use ecosystems at our properties marked by a healthy mix of multifamily housing, healthcare services, fulfillment centers, and other uses alongside our robust retail, dining and entertainment lineups. We appreciate the support of our bank lending group, and their collective confidence in our portfolio and the progress we are making in positioning PREIT for long-term success. This agreement provides us with the liquidity to compete effectively, meet our obligations, and continue providing our tenants, customers and communities with the high-quality shopping experience they expect at our properties."" Under the terms of the agreement, PREIT would have access to $150 million in new capital to strengthen the business and provide financial flexibility. Specifically, the banks will convert the Company's existing credit facilities into a $150 million first lien senior secured facility, a $919 million facility consisting of a first lien senior secured term loan facility and a second lien secured term loan facility all of which will have a two-year term with a 1-year extension option.  The Company's current pool of unencumbered assets will serve as collateral for the facility and the Company will retain 30% of proceeds from non-income producing asset sales.  The agreement remains subject to finalization of definitive documentation and the approval of 100 percent of the bank group. The Company is working toward completing this process before the end of October. If the Company is unable to secure the support of the remaining lenders holding less than 20% of the debt, it may need to complete this restructuring through a prepackaged reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The purpose of such a process, if necessary, would be to implement the agreement that already has the support of over 80% of the Company's bank lenders. As such, the Company expects that any prepackaged reorganization process would be expedited, and that it would have no impact on shareholders, suppliers and other trade creditors, business partners, or other stakeholders, all of whom would be unimpaired.  The Company will continue operating as normal with a primary focus on the health and safety of its employees, partners, customers and communities.  Coradino concluded, ""Given the significant support we have already received from a substantial majority of our lenders, we are confident in our ability to implement the recapitalization agreement quickly and efficiently. We appreciate the support of our bank lenders, tenants, and customers, and above all, we are grateful for the continued dedication of our relentless team of associates at PREIT.  We are excited to take another big step forward in positioning PREIT for an even more successful future.""

Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that can be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""may"" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans, strategies, anticipated events, trends and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future events and conditions and are based on currently available financial, economic and competitive data and our current business plans. Actual results could vary materially depending on risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that may affect our operations, markets, services, prices and other factors as discussed in the Risk Factors section of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements as it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement (the ""RSA"") we have entered into; risks attendant to the bankruptcy process, including our ability to obtain court approvals with respect to motions filed in the chapter 11 cases contemplated by the RSA (the ""Chapter 11 Cases""), the outcomes of court rulings and the Chapter 11 Cases in general and the length of time that we may be required to operate in bankruptcy; the effectiveness of the overall restructuring activities pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases and any additional strategies that we may employ to address our liquidity and capital resources; the actions and decisions of creditors, regulators and other third parties that have an interest in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; restrictions on us due to the terms of any debtor-in-possession credit facility that we will enter into in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and restrictions imposed by the applicable courts; our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue and pro forma leverage ratio and generate free cash flow to further reduce our indebtedness; our ability to manage our business through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakening of global economic and financial conditions, changes in governmental regulations and related compliance and litigation costs and the other factors listed in our SEC filings. Additionally, our business might be materially and adversely affected by changes in the retail and real estate industries, including consolidation and store closings, particularly among anchor tenants; current economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to reduce its spread, and the corresponding effects on tenant business performance, prospects, solvency and leasing decisions; our inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; our ability to maintain and increase property occupancy, sales and rental rates; increases in operating costs that cannot be passed on to tenants; the effects of online shopping and other uses of technology on our retail tenants; risks related to our development and redevelopment activities, including delays, cost overruns and our inability to reach projected occupancy or rental rates; acts of violence at malls, including our properties, or at other similar spaces, and the potential effect on traffic and sales; our ability to sell properties that we seek to dispose of or our ability to obtain prices we seek; our substantial debt and the liquidation preference of our preferred shares and our high leverage ratio and our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants under our debt facilities; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, on favorable terms or at all; our ability to raise capital, including through sales of properties or interests in properties and through the issuance of equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable; and potential dilution from any capital raising transactions or other equity issuances. Additional factors that might cause future events, achievements or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements include those discussed herein, and in the sections entitled ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020.

"Boralex becomes the sole owner of 3 Quebec wind farms, with a 296 MW installed capacity MONTREAL, Nov. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Boralex Inc. (""Boralex"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSX: BLX) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the full 49% equity stake held by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (""CDPQ"") in 3 wind farms in Quebec, already 51% owned by Boralex. CDPQ's 49% equity stake represents 145 MW net installed capacity and the three wind farms represent a total capacity of 296 MW. Located in the Avignon RCM in Gaspésie and the Appalaches RCM in eastern Quebec, these farms are equipped with Enercon turbines and benefit from long-term power purchase agreements (""PPAs"") with Hydro-Québec Distribution, expiring between 2032 and 2033 with a weighted average remaining contract duration of nearly 12.5 years. ""We're very pleased to announce our acquisition of CDPQ's stake in high-quality wind farms that we already own 51% of and have managed for over two years following our acquisition of Invenergy's stakes in these assets. Operating these wind farms provided the expected synergies and has yielded results 10% better than we had expected in 2019"", says Patrick Lemaire, Boralex's President and CEO. ""This transaction strengthens our position in the wind industry in Canada and is perfectly aligned with the growth orientation of our strategic plan. Acquiring CDPQ's stake will add significant cash flow for the coming years and a positive contribution to the company's discretionary cash flow per share in the first year after the transaction closes. We also expect to generate additional operational and financial synergies in the coming years,"" adds Patrick Decostre, Boralex's Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. As part of the acquisition, Boralex will pay a cash consideration of $121.5 million to CDPQ on closing, which may be supplemented by a conditional consideration of up to $4 million subject to the settlement of certain future conditions that need to be met. The closing is expected to take place at the end of November 2020, subject to standard closing conditions. Following this transaction, Boralex's installed capacity will be 2,212 MW. Highlights Wind farm descriptionDes Moulins I wind farm (136 MW) is located in the Appalaches RCM in Quebec. This farm has 59 E-82 wind turbines. Des Moulins II wind farm (21 MW) is located in the Avignon RCM in Gaspésie, Quebec. This farm has nine E-92 wind turbines. Both farms are covered by an existing PPA that expires in December 2033. Le Plateau I wind farm (139 MW) is located in the Avignon RCM in Gaspésie, Quebec. This park has 60 E-70 E4 wind turbines and is covered by an existing PPA that expires in March 2032. Each wind farm is funded on a long-term basis through consortiums of international financial institutions. Financing consists of a combination of variable interest rate term loans (a large portion of which is covered by interest rate swaps) and notes or fixed rate loans. Project debt as at September 30, 2020, totalled $402 million (the 49% equity stake is therefore $197 million). Questions relating to related party transactionsCDPQ holds approximately 17.28% of the Corporation's issued and outstanding common shares as at November 20, 2020. The acquisition could be considered a ""related party transaction"" under MI 61-101 for the Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (MI 61–101). The Corporation has availed itself of the exceptions for evaluation and approval of minority holders in paragraphs 5.5(a) and 5.7(a) in MI 61-101. The two independent directors representing CDPQ on the Boralex board of directors did not participate in the discussions on the acquisition, and they abstained from voting on these matters.

In accordance with Delaware law, each of the Charter Amendments became effective immediately upon filing. As a result of the Charter Amendments and as a matter of law, a stockholder owning fewer than 50 shares of common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split (the ""Reverse Stock Split Effective Time""), which occurred on March 19, 2020 at 6:51 P.M. EDT, became entitled to a fraction of a share of common stock upon the Reverse Stock Split and is entitled to be paid cash in lieu of such fraction of a share of common stock, on the basis of $30.00, without interest (the ""Cash Payment""), for each share of common stock held by such holder (the ""Cashed Out Stockholders"") immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split Effective Time. Original Process In consultation with DTC and Equiniti Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, the Company established a process whereby Cashed Out Stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" through a bank, broker or other nominee (each, a ""Nominee"") must complete and send a form (the ""Original Form"") to Equiniti in order to establish that such Cashed Out Stockholder held fewer than 50 shares immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split Effective Time. The Original Form was made available to Nominees through DTC on June 22, 2020. Alternative Process in Light of COVID-19 Based upon feedback, the Company is now providing an alternative process to accommodate Cashed Out Stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" who are experiencing challenges in completing the Original Form in light of COVID-19.  Among other changes to accommodate such stockholders, the process has been revised so that stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" are not required to submit the Original Form or any other paperwork if their Nominee is taking advantage of the new process and completes a new form (the ""New Form"") which is available to Nominees through DTC's LENS System.  Additionally, the deadline for Nominees to submit this New Form has been extended from July 20, 2020 to no later than 5:00 P.M., prevailing New York City time on July 31, 2020 (note however that there is no change to the DTC instruction deadline of July 20, 2020 for Nominees to deliver shares).  Next Steps for Cashed Out Stockholders As noted above, the Company has designed this alternative process in light of the challenges presented by COVID-19 so that Nominees taking advantage of this alternative process can fill out the New Form on behalf of its clients. As a result, the Company will not require that Cashed Out Stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" submit the Old Form or any other paperwork.  Cashed Out Stockholders who own shares directly as a ""holder of record"" will receive the Cash Payment as soon as reasonably practicable following the Expiration Time.

"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --  Legal-Bay, The Pre Settlement Funding Company, announces the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of The Diocese of Rockville Centre in Long Island—a suburb of New York City—in response to a torrent of lawsuits brought forth by numerous victims. The bankruptcy declaration is the U.S.'s largest ever filed by a Roman Catholic church, and the 3rd in New York State after Buffalo's and Rochester's filings. The state of New York recently suspended their statute of limitations, giving victims an extended period to file lawsuits over sexual abuse by priests. Chris Janish, CEO of Legal-Bay, commented, ""Legal-Bay has always been an advocate for plaintiffs in clergy sexual abuse cases, and has continued to fund some of the litigations even while dioceses declare bankruptcy.  The current filing follows a strategy now being employed by many organizations—including the Boy Scouts of America—to thwart paying damages. It remains to be seen if this will ultimately be beneficial or harmful to the victims who have suffered.""   If you have been or know a victim of any type of sexual assault or harassment and need an immediate cash advance, please visit Legal-Bay HERE or call toll-free at 877.571.0405. Aside from sexual abuse loans for settlements, Legal-Bay also provides settlement loan funding for all types of cases including personal injury, car accident, medical malpractice, judgment on appeal, commercial litigation, and more. Their loans for lawsuits have helped numerous plaintiffs through many a financial crisis.   Legal-Bay's loan settlement programs provide immediate cash in advance of a plaintiff's anticipated monetary award. The non-recourse law suit ""loans"" —sometimes referred to as loans for lawsuit or loans on settlement—are risk-free, as the money doesn't need to be repaid should the recipient lose their case. Therefore, the lawsuit loan isn't really a loan, but rather a cash advance.  To apply now, please visit us HERE or call toll-free at: 877.571.0405 where agents are standing by.

The Company expects to use the time and legal protections made available through the Chapter 11 process to continue discussions with financial stakeholders, as well as critical conversations with its landlords, to achieve a comprehensive balance sheet restructuring that supports its re-opening and longer-term strategic plans. CEC franchised locations operate under separate legal and financial structures and are not included in the Chapter 11 filings. As of June 24, 266 company-operated Chuck E Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza restaurant and arcade venues had safely re-opened, in accordance with all CDC, federal, state and local guidelines. Subject to ongoing negotiations with its landlords, the Company expects to maintain ongoing operations in these locations throughout the Chapter 11 process, providing dine-in, delivery and carry-out services, hosting birthday parties during dedicated hours, and supporting fundraisers and events in the coming weeks and months. The Company also plans to continue opening additional locations each week, steadily bringing more employees back to work.  ""The Chapter 11 process will allow us to strengthen our financial structure as we recover from what has undoubtedly been the most challenging event in our Company's history and get back to the business of delivering memories, entertainment, and pizzas for another 40 years and beyond,"" said David McKillips, CEC's Chief Executive Officer. ""I am incredibly proud of what the CEC team has achieved over the past year as we launched the All You Can Play value gaming platform, expanded our remodel program and found new ways to engage with families while our venues were closed. I'm confident in the strength of our team and our world-class brands and look forward to more fully implementing our strategic plan as we put these financial challenges behind us."" The Company has filed customary motions with the Bankruptcy Court intended to allow CEC to maintain operations in the ordinary course including, but not limited to, paying employees and continuing existing benefits programs, honoring guest gift cards, and upholding commitments under its franchising and licensing agreements. The motions are typical in the Chapter 11 process and CEC anticipates that they will be heard and approved in the first few days of the Chapter 11 cases. CEC's Chapter 11 cases will be heard in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.

"PHILADELPHIA, June 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), a leading publicly traded business development company focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies, announced that it expects to implement a reverse stock split, to be effective on or around June 15, 2020, which was approved by the board of directors of the Company on May 26, 2020. As a result of the reverse stock split, the share count will be reduced on a 4 : 1 basis, such that each shareholder will receive 1 share for every 4 shares owned. The Company also intends to file a separate Articles of Amendment to its charter to provide that there will be no change in the par value of $0.001 per share as a result of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split is expected to be effective for trading purposes on June 16, 2020.  There is not expected to be any direct economic consequence to the Company or its shareholders from the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will not change the authorized number of shares of the Company's common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all shareholders uniformly and will not alter any shareholder's percentage interest in the Company's equity, except to the extent that the reverse stock split would result in some shareholders owning a fractional share. In that regard, no fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse split. Shareholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive a cash payment based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the effective date of the amendment to the Company's charter effecting the reverse stock split. As previously disclosed, the Company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.15 per share, which will be paid on or about July 2, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2020.

"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases, in an all cash transaction for approximately $6.5 billion.  This acquisition provides an opportunity for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson to broaden its leadership in immune-mediated diseases and drive further growth through expansion into autoantibody-driven disease. The transaction will include full global rights to nipocalimab (M281), a clinically validated, potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. Nipocalimab gives Janssen the opportunity to reach significantly more patients by pursuing indications across many autoimmune diseases with substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Nipocalimab recently received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Momenta's expertise in FcRn mechanisms is especially important for nipocalimab as it supports and accelerates the development of a medicine designed to target a number of autoantibody-driven conditions across several of Janssen's established therapeutic areas. Janssen expects nipocalimab to contribute to its goals of achieving above-market growth over the mid and long term. Autoimmune diseases driven partially or completely by autoantibodies represent a novel area where Janssen can significantly improve health outcomes for patients. In autoantibody-driven diseases, the body's antibodies attack or damage its own proteins, cells and tissues, often with devastating consequences. Autoantibody-driven diseases include Myasthenia Gravis, Hemolytic Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn, warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, and other serious dermatologic, rheumatic, neurologic, hematologic and renal diseases. An estimated 2.5 percent of the population, or approximately 195 million people worldwide, suffer from some form of autoantibody-driven disease, many of which are orphan and rare diseases. With competitively differentiated, parallel development programs and full worldwide commercial rights for nipocalimab, Janssen will have the potential to introduce multiple  launches, many as first-in-class indications with potential for significant peak year sales, some of which could exceed $1 billion, supporting Janssen's goal of continuing to deliver above-market performance over the long term.  ""This acquisition broadens Janssen's leadership in autoimmune diseases and provides us with a major catalyst for sustained growth. Autoantibody-driven diseases are often serious, and patients are underserved by current treatment options,"" said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson. ""We're excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care by combining Johnson & Johnson's world-class R&D, commercial and supply chain capabilities with Momenta's talented people, pipeline and deep expertise in this important area."" In addition to Momenta's employees and lead asset nipocalimab, Janssen will acquire Momenta's pipeline of clinical and pre-clinical assets. The acquisition was driven by the significant opportunity seen in nipocalimab, along with the scientific capability Janssen is acquiring with the Momenta team. Janssen's plans for additional assets in the Momenta pipeline will be determined as more data become available and could offer further upside potential. ""Nipocalimab, and the rest of Momenta's pipeline, built over many years by outstanding scientists who have turned important insights into actionable biology, expands and complements our portfolio by giving us clinical-stage and discovery-stage compounds in autoantibody biological pathways. Combining Momenta's discoveries with our 20-year heritage in immunology, global scope, and scientific and medical expertise, we see a real opportunity to create an entire 'pipeline in a pathway,'"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""We are excited about the significant potential to expand on Momenta's excellent progress in rare diseases, and to increase our impact on patients both within and beyond our current focus areas."" Janssen plans to retain Momenta's presence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This site will increase Johnson & Johnson's existing innovation footprint and capabilities in the greater Boston area given Momenta's talented scientists, suite of proprietary technologies, sophisticated laboratories and proximity to top talent in this innovation hub.  About the AgreementUnder the terms of the transaction, which was approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Vigor Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (the Company), will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Momenta for $52.50 per share. The closing of the offer is conditioned on the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Momenta's common stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The $6.1 billion estimated net value of the transaction is based on Momenta's estimated fully diluted shares outstanding, less estimated net cash at time of closing. Assuming the closing of the tender offer, the Company will acquire any shares of Momenta not tendered into the tender offer through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Momenta for the same per share consideration as will be payable in the tender offer. The merger will be effected as soon as practicable after the closing of the tender offer. Following completion of the merger, Momenta's common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. While the closing of the transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive, the Company is maintaining its current 2020 Adjusted EPSi guidance range. Looking ahead, the costs associated with the development of Momenta's portfolio are expected to be incremental to planned R&D investment levels over the next few years given the value creation potential of our current portfolio, and thus expect this incremental investment in R&D to have an EPS impact worth approximately $0.10-$0.15 in 2021. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination. About Janssen's Approach to Autoimmune DiseaseJanssen has pioneered breakthrough science in autoimmune diseases with five approved therapies to treat more than 30 pediatric and adult indications. Significant unmet need remains, since many autoimmune diseases have few or no approved treatments, and only a small fraction of those living with autoimmune disease ever achieve sustained clinical remission. Janssen pursues research and development in both functional manifestations of disease (disease area strongholds) and biological pathways (pathway area strongholds). Biological pathways identify mechanisms through which seemingly dissimilar diseases can be connected by genetic, molecular or cellular systems in the body. It is now understood that multiple, diverse autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need are linked by the same immune pathways.  Janssen's pathways-centric strategy opens the door to fully develop compounds for multiple diseases sharing a common pathway, thus challenging the concept of one drug for one disease. In addition, as scientific understanding of the immune system expands, there is increasing recognition of its impact on more diseases than previously understood.

Having said that, we are pleased to be in discussions with interested bidders for our cementing business and for certain portions of our fracturing business and technology."" The Company is developing a plan with its stakeholders to minimize disruption to current client activity as much as feasible and will be reaching out to clients to discuss available options.

""I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to our employees for their tireless commitment to the Company, and to our clients, suppliers and other business partners for their continued support during these challenging times,"" Mr. Zemlak added. ""I want to assure our business partners that our team is as focused as ever on working with our stakeholders to procure sufficient liquidity to complete all client activities safely and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.""

"TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Libbey Inc. (OTC: LBYYQ) (""Libbey"" or the ""Company""), one of the world's largest glass tableware manufacturers, filed an Amended Plan of Reorganization (the ""Plan"") and a related Disclosure Statement today in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (""the Court""). The Plan outlines the Company's proposal to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce debt and improve liquidity in order to emerge from bankruptcy as a financially stronger company.   As contemplated under the terms of the Plan, Libbey has received a term sheet from seven of its lenders to provide $150 million in exit financing, which net of lender fees and repayment of the Company's existing debtor-in-possession (""DIP"") financing will provide $75 million of incremental funding for the Company's exit from bankruptcy and go-forward operations. Libbey also expects to replace its $100 million DIP revolving credit facility with a new exit facility with approximately $20 million initially drawn. Overall, Libbey expects to emerge from the Chapter 11 process with less than $200 million of funded debt, compared to more than $400 million of debt that existed at the beginning of the court-supervised process.  Additionally, as required under the terms of the Plan, Libbey today filed motions with the Court to modify its collective bargaining agreements (""CBAs"") and certain union-related retiree benefits. If approved by the Court, the motions will modify the CBAs for Libbey employees represented by the United Steelworkers and the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers. Under the terms of the Company's proposals to the unions, Libbey is seeking to modify wages, certain benefits (including freezing future benefit accruals under its hourly defined benefit pension plan) and certain work rules for its U.S. union employees. In addition to these proposed modifications, the Company has also taken actions to reduce its salaried headcount and the wage and benefit costs relating to its salaried employees, as well as non-salary related costs. All of these actions, including the proposed modifications to the Company's CBAs and certain union-related retiree benefit obligations, provide cost reductions that are essential to the Company's successful reorganization.  As part of optimizing its manufacturing capacity, Libbey has committed to its previously announced plan to close its manufacturing facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The Company intends to cease production by the end of 2020, with full closure to be completed by the second half of 2022. Libbey continues to negotiate with the United Steelworkers representing the Company's employees regarding the effects of the facility closure. Mike Bauer, chief executive officer of Libbey, said, ""We continue to make important progress and are on a path to complete our restructuring later this year. While we recognize the impact of the proposed modifications to the CBAs for our union employees and union retirees, we believe the changes are essential to ensure our successful emergence from Chapter 11. The cost savings and operational improvements they will help us achieve will preserve approximately 1,200 U.S. jobs and make Libbey a stronger company going forward. We remain committed to continuing good-faith negotiations with our unions throughout this process.""   Mr. Bauer continued, ""As we take the final steps in this court-supervised process, we continue to serve customers and end users globally. As always, we remain focused on providing the high-quality products, service and community commitment that define Libbey. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their continued hard work and dedication, as well as all our stakeholders for their continued support."" A Court hearing to consider approval of the Disclosure Statement related to the Plan is scheduled for August 21, 2020. Following Court approval of the Disclosure Statement, Libbey will distribute the Plan and Disclosure Statement to voting creditors for their consideration. This press release is not intended as a solicitation for a vote on the Plan. Any such solicitation will be made pursuant to and in accordance with the Disclosure Statement and applicable law, including orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan and Disclosure Statement contain or discuss certain financial projections and analysis (collectively, ""Projections and Analysis""). The Projections and Analysis are based on estimates and assumptions that may not materialize, were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and should not be relied upon to make an investment decision with respect to the Company. The Projections and Analysis do not purport to present the Company's financial condition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and have not been examined or compiled by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

Neiman Marcus Group Receives Court Approval to Access Debtor-In-Possession Financing Facility",bankruptcy
"WILMINGTON, Del., Aug. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Takata Tort Compensation Trust Fund has taken legal action against one of Takata's Japanese insurance companies, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., to enforce Takata's Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization and Confirmation Order and recover money for hundreds of US victims injured or killed by Takata's defective exploding airbag inflators.  The motion marks the first legal action by the Trust against Takata's Japan-based insurers in connection with Takata's defective airbag inflators. The motion, filed in the bankruptcy proceedings of Takata Corporation's U.S.-based subsidiaries, asserts that Tokio, which issued products liability policies insuring Takata pre-bankruptcy, has repudiated the Delaware Bankruptcy Court Plan's transfer of Takata's rights under those policies to the Trust solely to avoid its coverage obligations and reap a windfall from Takata's bankruptcy.  Tokio was paid millions of dollars in premiums by the defunct airbag manufacturer before it pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges and filed for bankruptcy, and the Trust's motion asserts that the insurance proceeds are supposed to be there to compensate Takata's personal injury and wrongful death victims. As detailed in the motion, the Plan established the Trust to process and pay claims of victims who were injured or killed by airbags manufactured and sold by Takata.  The Plan contemplated that the Trust would be funded, potentially in large part, by the rights and proceeds of Takata's products liability insurance policies.  Accordingly, the Plan transferred Takata's rights under all policies potentially applicable to the victims' claims to the Trust as of the Plan's effective date. The insurance rights transfer provision was the product of intense negotiations by Takata and its victims to reach swift resolution of a large and complex bankruptcy and to ensure that victims received prompt and reasonable compensation.  Upon confirmation of the Plan in February 2017, the judge presiding over the bankruptcy proceedings praised the efforts of everyone involved, noting the amount of work necessary to reach a largely consensual agreement in such a complex case so quickly. Due to the Trust's limited existing assets to pay claims, to date the victims of Takata's products have recovered only a fraction of the value of their claims.  Tokio has now asserted, to the victims' detriment, that it has no obligations to provide coverage for the claims under its policies—despite the fact that Tokio had been paying for such claims against Takata prior to the bankruptcy. In its motion filed earlier today, the Trust asks the Bankruptcy Court to order Tokio to comply with the Plan's insurance rights transfer provision by acknowledging that the Trust is the holder of Takata's rights under the Tokio policies, and to sanction Tokio for its violation of the Court's Order, including reimbursing the Trust for the legal costs of making the motion. Professor Eric D. Green, The Trustee of the Takata Airbag Tort Compensation Trust Fund, reported that the Trust was forced to take this legal action ""because of Tokio's absolute refusal to abide by the express assignment of insurance rights to the Trust under the bankruptcy plan.""  ""Takata's reckless behavior in making this timebomb and putting it in people's cars as a supposed safety device was bad enough,"" Professor Green said, ""but now, adding insult to injury, Takata's Japanese insurer is refusing to honor its obligations under its policies and as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.  It is a dishonorable and surprising attack on these victims in the United States who have been wounded and maimed by Tokio's insured's conduct.  We will fight to make things right,"" Professor Green said. The Takata Tort Compensation Trust Fund is represented in the matter by Gilbert LLP, as lead counsel, and Brown Rudnick LLP as co-counsel.
