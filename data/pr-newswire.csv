Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, all outstanding ordinary shares of the Company (each, an ""Ordinary Share""), including Ordinary Shares represented by American depositary shares, each representing four Ordinary Shares (""ADSs""), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and ADSs representing Excluded Shares, will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holders thereof to receive $2.45 in cash per Ordinary Share (the ""Per Share Merger Consideration""), or $9.80 in cash per ADS (the ""Per ADS Merger Consideration"").  The Per ADS Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 35.7% to the closing trading price of the ADSs on June 5, 2020, the last trading day prior to the Company's announcement of its receipt of a ""going-private"" proposal from Mr. Zhu, Ms. Yin, and their affiliated entity, and a premium of 37.1% to the volume-weighted average closing price of the ADSs during the last 30 trading days prior to the Company's receipt of the ""going-private"" proposal. The Merger Agreement provides that each outstanding share option (each, a ""Company Option"") to purchase Ordinary Shares, whether vested or unvested, that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, will be cancelled and exchanged for the holder's right to receive, at or promptly after the effectiveness of the Merger, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option by (ii) the number of Ordinary Shares underlying such Company Option.  Each Ordinary Share subject to a Company restricted share award (each, a ""Company Restricted Share Award""), whether vested or unvested, that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, except for the Company Restricted Share Awards held by Mr. Zhu and Ms. Yin, will be cancelled and exchanged for the holder's right to receive, at or promptly after the effectiveness of the Merger, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration.   The Company's board of directors (the ""Board""), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a committee of independent and disinterested directors established by the Board (the ""Special Committee""), approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger and resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders vote to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

Fertiláqua gives ICL a significant foothold in a major market, where demand growth for specialty plant nutrition products is increasing rapidly. In addition, it unlocks immediate synergies for distribution in Brazil and further expands ICL's product portfolio with higher growth, higher margin products, as well as provides balance for seasonality in our specialty fertilizer sales between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.""

"PITTSBURGH, Oct. 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --   Key Highlights 
 Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS), the global leader and innovator of engineering simulation software, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), a premier provider of mission-driven simulation, modeling, testing and analysis software for aerospace, defense and intelligence applications. Once closed, the acquisition will expand the scope of Ansys' solution offering, empowering users to solve challenges by simulating from the chip now all the way to a customers' entire mission – like tracking an orbiting satellite and its periodic connection to ground stations. The purchase price for the transaction is $700 million, of which 67% of the consideration will be paid in cash and 33% will be paid through the issuance of Ansys common stock. In conjunction with the transaction, Ansys anticipates obtaining new debt financing to fund a significant portion of the cash component of the purchase price. AGI has pioneered digital mission engineering, a key component of digital transformation. Once closed, the acquisition of AGI will expand Ansys' simulation footprint into customers' missions, an area of simulation beyond the traditional component or product level. Missions are typically higher-level endeavors that support space, telecommunications, national defense and search-and-rescue initiatives. Mission-driven simulation, integrated with systems engineering, enables organizations to provide the best configuration to achieve various desired mission objectives.  Digital mission engineering empowers organizations to evaluate then optimize the performance of engineered systems across the overall mission. It also helps them effectively respond to evolving mission objectives, which often change during the course of a system's lifecycle. As a result, these missions are more likely to succeed, saving the customer time, money and other crucial resources. As an example, experts project that more than 10,000 satellites will be launched into orbit in the next five years. AGI's software will help its customers design, launch, and safely operate the next generation of satellite constellations which are critical for navigation, earth imagery, weather and communications. AGI's software models and simulates many important elements, such as a satellite's orbital mechanics, enabling users to design, operate or use space systems with improved efficiency and effectiveness. Based in Exton, Pa., AGI has a 30-year track record of success across industries, with hundreds of customers around the world, particularly in the government and federal aerospace and defense industries. As an existing Ansys partner, AGI's technology already connects into the Ansys simulation portfolio. Once closed, AGI's strong customer relationships will help Ansys reach new aerospace and defense customers while the Ansys sales channel can drive mission-based simulation to its broader existing installed base.  ""Ansys' acquisition of AGI will help drive our strategy of making simulation pervasive from the smallest component now through a customer's entire mission,"" said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys. ""It will also expand the use of simulation in the key aerospace sector, where the stakes can be at their highest levels. We are excited to welcome the expert AGI team – and to expand the reach of their world-class technology to industries outside of aerospace, including for autonomy and 5G applications.""  ""In the three decades since our founding, we have continuously invested in our technology to create and advance digital mission engineering,"" said Paul Graziani, CEO and co-founder of AGI. ""We are thrilled to become part of Ansys so we can dramatically extend the reach of our world-class products and help more customers accomplish their critical missions.""  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to receipt of regulatory clearance and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is not expected to have a meaningful impact on the 2020 non-GAAP results. Ansys expects that the transaction will add $75 million to $85 million of non-GAAP revenue to its 2021 results and will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP projections exclude the effects of acquisition adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and transaction costs related to the acquisition. The corresponding GAAP revenue and diluted earnings per share measures are not estimable on a forward-looking basis at this time, as such measures require a fair valuation to be performed on the net assets purchased, which will be completed subsequent to the closing.

"JINJIANG, China, Sept. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- China Ceramics Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ Capital Market: CCCL) (""China Ceramics"" or the ""Company""), a leading Chinese manufacturer of ceramic tiles used for exterior siding and for interior flooring and design in residential and commercial buildings, today announced that its Board of Directors has set the date of September 3, 2020 to be the effective date for the Company's reverse stock split.  The Company's ordinary shares will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on September 3, 2020. The new CUSIP number for the Company's common stock following the reverse split is G2113X159. The Company's Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split so as to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market. In order to maintain the Company's listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company's common stock must have a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days by September 21, 2020. There can be no assurance that following the reverse split, the Company's common stock will remain above $1.00 per share minimum for the requisite period as of September 21, 2020 to regain listing compliance. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, its securities may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market which, in turn, will result in significant adverse effect on the value and liquidity of the Company's securities. As a result of the reverse stock split, every three issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of the effective date will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share. Consequently, the reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding ordinary shares of the Company from approximately 9.2 million shares to approximately 3.1 million shares, and the par value per share will increase from $0.008 to $0.024. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company will issue one full share of the post-reverse stock split common share to any stockholder who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share. All outstanding stock options, warrants and other rights to purchase the Company's ordinary shares will be adjusted proportionately as a result of the reverse stock split.  Once the reverse stock split becomes effective, shareholders holding shares through a bank, broker or other nominee will have their shares automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.  Beneficial holders may contact their bank, broker or nominee for more information.  Shareholders holding physical certificates of ordinary shares will receive a letter of transmittal from the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust, with specific instructions regarding the exchange of shares. Please direct any questions to your broker or the Company's Transfer Agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust, by calling 212-509-4000. About China Ceramics Co., Ltd.

"CLEVELAND, Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cobham Aero Connectivity (""CAC"" or ""the Company"") for approximately $965 million in cash, including tax benefits.   Additionally, TransDigm provided an update with regard to its previously announced plans to potentially divest a select number of defense-oriented operating units that were acquired as part of the Esterline acquisition. Acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity (""CAC"") Cobham Aero Connectivity is headquartered in Marlow, UK.  The Company is a leading provider of highly engineered antennas and radios for the aerospace end market. The products are primarily proprietary with significant aftermarket content and have a strong presence across major defense platforms as well as select commercial applications.  The Company is expected to generate approximately $225 million in revenue in 2020.  Nearly 60% of CAC's revenue is derived from international sales, and the Company has a strong presence across a diverse range of both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.  The Company operates from two primary facilities in Marlow, UK and Prescott, Arizona.  CAC employs approximately 760 people. The acquisition, which is expected to close during the first calendar quarter of 2021, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.  The acquisition is expected to be financed through existing cash on hand. Potential Divestitures of Former Esterline Operating Units The operating units under consideration for potential divestiture were acquired by TransDigm in March 2019 as part of the Esterline Technologies acquisition. Since the acquisition, these businesses have functioned as independent operating units under TransDigm's ownership. These operating units primarily serve the defense end market and have combined annual revenue of $250 to $300 million.  TransDigm is now working with outside advisors to assist in the process of identifying and approaching potential buyers.  At this time, the timeline for any announced divestitures remains uncertain. W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm's Executive Chairman, stated, ""We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity. This business fits well with our long-standing strategy. The CAC products are almost all proprietary and over 70% of CAC's revenue comes from the aftermarket. The Company is primarily a defense business. The businesses we are considering for divestiture are also good businesses, but do not fit as well with our long-standing proprietary and aftermarket strategy."" Kevin Stein, TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, added, ""We are excited about the acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity.  The Company has established positions across a diverse range of new and existing aircraft platforms.  Major customers include Airbus, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies, AgustaWestland/Leonardo and Elbit. We also see significant opportunity for ongoing upgrade and retrofit activity as the demand for faster and more data intensive communication continues. As with all TransDigm acquisitions, we expect the CAC acquisition to create equity value in-line with our long-term private equity-like return objectives."" About TransDigm TransDigm Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today.

"Landmark deal by global, cloud commerce leader grows Lightspeed's U.S. footprint by more than 20,000 customer locations following listing on the New York Stock Exchange  MONTREAL, Nov. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Lightspeed POS Inc. (NYSE: LSPD) (TSX: LSPD), a leading provider of cloud-based, omnichannel commerce platforms, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ShopKeep Inc. (ShopKeep), a leading cloud commerce platform provider based in New York City. This acquisition reinforces Lightspeed's status as a clear category leader for complex retailers and restaurateurs seeking to modernize their operations as the global economy undergoes unprecedented digital acceleration.  COVID-19 is forcing independent businesses to urgently replace legacy point-of-sale systems in order to remain operational and safely adapt to evolving consumer behaviors. The scale achieved by the combination of Lightspeed and ShopKeep presents retail and restaurant business owners in the United States with enhanced resources to pivot their operations. Lightspeed's analytics, loyalty, eCommerce, and payments modules, in addition to its multi-location solution, will offer ShopKeep's customer base the opportunity to enhance their capabilities. The acquisition immediately expands Lightspeed's U.S. market share, allowing for increased investment in sales, marketing, and research and development to capitalize on the increasing demand for modern, cloud-based, omnichannel commerce solutions. Following the closing of the acquisition, Lightspeed will serve over 100,000 customer locations1 worldwide, generating approximately $33 billion USD in gross transaction volume2 (GTV). ""ShopKeep's commitment to enabling independent businesses to dream big and rise above industry and economic challenges is deeply aligned with our own mission to power the future of commerce,"" said Dax Dasilva, Founder and CEO of Lightspeed. ""This acquisition will bring ShopKeep merchants, small and medium-sized businesses that make up the backbone of the U.S economy, into the Lightspeed family, providing them even more crucial product innovation and world-class support as they drive the reinvention of American commerce.""  The acquisition will generate strong expected synergies resulting from increased GTV, the ability to leverage integrated go-to-market resources and a combined payments opportunity. Once closed, Lightspeed's acquisition of ShopKeep will follow the successful integration of multiple premier platforms that experienced accelerated growth following their acquisitions by Lightspeed, including that of Montréal-based Chronogolf, Sydney-based Kounta and Berlin-based Gastrofix.  ""We believe uniting with Lightspeed highlights and amplifies our shared vision to deliver industry leading commerce enablement for small and medium-sized businesses,"" said Michael DeSimone, CEO of ShopKeep. ""Our partnership sets the stage to help business owners navigate through challenging times, keep pace with rapid change and adapt quickly to meet the rising demands of today's customers."" Details of transaction: ShopKeep generated revenue of approximately $50 million3 and GTV of approximately $7 billion in the trailing twelve month period ending September 2020. Lightspeed will acquire ShopKeep for a total estimated consideration of approximately $440 million, satisfied by way of payment on closing of $145.2 million in cash and the issuance of 9,500,000 subordinate voting shares in the capital of Lightspeed, subject to the adjustment mechanisms outlined in footnote 4 below.4 The deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions and post-closing working capital adjustment, is expected to close before the end of the company's quarter ending December 31, 2020.  Additional details regarding this transaction will be communicated during Lightspeed's Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call, which is scheduled for Thursday, November 5, 2020.

The action will take effect at the open of trading on Thursday, July 30, 2020.

The reverse stock split is being implemented with the goals of increasing the per-share trading price to ultimately reach the $4.00 regular bid price required by Nasdaq, and improving the marketability and liquidity of the common stock.  ""This reverse split will help GRWC normalize trading and better align with our business activity,"" said interim CEO Terry Kennedy.

"IRVINE, Calif., July 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTC: BKFG) today announced that it has filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-10,000, followed immediately by the filing of a second Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a forward stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, at a ratio of 10,000-for-1.  The effective time of the reverse stock split was 6:00 p.m. ET on July 16, 2020, and the effective time of the forward stock split was 6:01 p.m. ET on July 16, 2020.   As a result of the reverse split, every 10,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of BKF Capital Group was automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock.  Any shares of common stock that would be converted into less than one share in the reverse split were instead converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to $9.50 per share of common stock held before the reverse split.  However, if a stockholder held at least 10,000 shares of common stock in his or her account at the effective time of the reverse split, any fractional share in such account resulting from the Reverse Split was not cashed out, but instead was automatically split and converted into 10,000 issued and outstanding share of common stock, so that the total number of shares held by these stockholders before the reverse split did not change as a result of the stock splits. The stock splits were approved by BKF Capital Group's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on July 16, 2020. BKF Capital Group has chosen its transfer agent, Equiniti, to act as the paying agent to manage the process by which stockholders who owned less than one share of common stock immediately following the reverse split will receive cash for their fractional shares.

"DULUTH, Ga., July 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: ABG), one of the largest automotive retail and service companies in the U.S., entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Park Place Dealerships, one of the country's largest and most prominent luxury dealer groups for $685 million of goodwill and approximately $50 million for parts, fixed assets, and leaseholds, excluding vehicle inventory. ""We are pleased our business model and performance allowed us to navigate the current environment and re-engage on a highly strategic acquisition that will make us an even stronger company. We have seen our new and used volume sequentially improve each week in May and June with higher profit per vehicle.  We have also seen our Parts and Service business improve in June as the economy gradually opens-up.  Strong May and June performance, along with cost restructuring efforts, have driven higher profitability and cash flow, giving us conviction to move forward with a revised Park Place acquisition. In March, we had to step away from the transaction due to lack of visibility around COVID-19, but after seeing the rebound off the April low, we can proceed with a more refined deal under more flexible and favorable terms"" said David Hult, Asbury's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Park Place is highly regarded as one of the best and most efficient operators of luxury stores in the industry.  Their portfolio of stores comes with a strong base of loyal clients and long-tenured team members throughout the high growth Dallas/Fort Worth market.  This acquisition will enhance our total portfolio and add approximately $1.7 billion in expected annualized revenues. We are thankful to all of our employees who have worked so hard over the last few months to manage through this pandemic. The talent in our organization and the resilience of the dealer model have put us in a position to acquire Park Place and become a more diversified company,"" Hult added. The operating assets to be acquired include 12 new vehicle franchises, all of which are located in the attractive Dallas/Fort Worth market: 3 Mercedes-Benz, 3 Sprinter, 2 Lexus, 1 Jaguar and 1 Land Rover, 1 Porsche, and 1 Volvo. The acquisition will also include the Park Place auto auction and two collision centers. The transaction is expected to increase Asbury's geographic mix to 28% of revenue derived from the Texas market, and further diversify the Company's overall portfolio from 36% to approximately 49% of revenue derived from luxury brands. The luxury segment has historically delivered strong and stable margins that are significantly above those achieved by mid-line import and domestic brands.  Luxury stores also tend to be more resilient in downturns, operate fewer dealers nation-wide and maintain a higher portion of gross profit from parts and service.   Park Place has a highly attractive mix of large dealerships with revenue comprised of 38% Mercedes-Benz, 37% Lexus, 12% Jaguar/Land Rover, 9% Porsche, and 5% Volvo.   Park Place owns and operates a portfolio of high volume, award winning luxury dealerships with premier real estate. Four stores are ranked among the top 10 stores in volume in the country amongst their franchise: Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Porsche, and the Jaguar/Land Rover store. In addition, the other Lexus store and the Volvo store are ranked in the top 20 nationally. Financial Impact The purchase price includes $685 million of goodwill and approximately $50 million for parts, fixed assets, and leaseholds, excluding vehicle inventory.  The transaction is targeted to close in the third quarter of 2020. It is subject to customary closing conditions.  The Company expects to achieve significant synergies over the next three years through integrating Park Place with Asbury. The purchase price reflects a 7.7x multiple on targeted EBITDA of $95 million, including run-rate synergies of at least $20 million, expected to be realized over the next three years. In addition, Asbury is expecting $10 million in annual cash tax savings from goodwill amortization with a present value of approximately $80 million. In all, the Company believes the returns on the Park Place investment will exceed its cost of capital and will deliver substantial value to shareholders. The acquisition of Park Place, assuming an end of August close, is expected to be accretive to 2021 earnings.  Asbury also expects to incur pre-tax costs associated with the transaction of approximately $0.20 per share in Q3 2020.

The Park Place transaction is expected to be funded through a combination of Asbury's existing credit facilities, seller financing, and cash on hand.  Although the transaction is expected to initially take the Company above its targeted leverage range, the strength of the business combined with free cash flow generation is expected to allow the Company to maintain a strong credit profile and deleverage to 3.0x within eighteen months.

"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Aberdeen Standard Global Infrastructure Income Fund (NYSE: ASGI) (the ""Fund""), a closed-end fund, today announced that it paid on November 10, 2020, a distribution of US $0.1083 per share to all shareholders of record as of November 3, 2020 (ex-dividend date November 2, 2020). As announced on August 31, 2020, the Fund will pay a fixed monthly distribution at an annualized rate of 6.5% on the initial public offering price of $20.00 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021. Your Fund's distribution policy is to provide investors with a stable monthly distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital.  Under U.S. tax rules applicable to the Fund, the amount and character of distributable income for each fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act"") and related Rules, the Fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the Rules adopted thereunder. The table has been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles.  The table includes estimated amounts and percentages for this distribution relating to fiscal year to date (10/01/2020 - 11/10/2020), from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated composition of the distributions may vary from month to month because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies. Estimated Amounts of Current Monthly Distribution per share ($) Estimated Amounts of Current Monthly Distribution per share (%) Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year to Date Cumulative Distributions per share ($) Estimated Amounts of Fiscal Year to Date Cumulative Distributions per share (%) Net Investment Income $0.0173 16% $0.0347 16% Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains* $0.0271 25% $0.0542 25% Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains  - - - - Return of Capital  $0.0639 59% $0.1277 59% Total (per common share)  $0.1083 100% $0.2166 100% *includes currency gains The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" As of October 20, 2020, after giving effect to this payment, the Fund estimates it has a net deficit of $687,000. A net deficit results when the Fund has net unrealized losses that are in excess of any net realized gains that have not yet been distributed. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the ""Distribution Policy""). The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2020 will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The following table provides information regarding the Fund's total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Fund's annualized and cumulative distribution rates. Average Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5 Year Period Ended 10/31/20201,2 (4.25%) Annualized Distribution Rate on NAV as of the Fiscal Period Ended 10/31/20203 6.83% Fiscal Year to Date (09/30/2020 to 10/31/2020) Cumulative Total Return on NAV1 (1.44%) Cumulative Distribution Rate on NAV2 0.57% 1 Return data is net of all Fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.2 The Fund launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception (July 29, 2020) through October 31, 2020.3 Based on the Fund's NAV as of October 31, 2020. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market. Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2010, the Fund may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Fund during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Fund, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the terms of the distribution policy. The final determination of the source of all distributions will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.  The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. The Fund's Board of Directors has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.

"PITTSBURGH, Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE: DKS), the largest U.S. based full-line omni-channel sporting goods retailer, today reported sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2020.  Third Quarter Results The Company reported consolidated net income for the third quarter ended October 31, 2020 of $177.2 million, or $1.84 per diluted share. As a result of actions taken to prioritize the health and well-being of its teammates and athletes, the Company incurred approximately $48 million of pre-tax incremental teammate compensation and safety costs in response to COVID-19, or $0.37 per diluted share, net of tax, during the current quarter. The Company reported consolidated net income for the third quarter ended November 2, 2019 of $57.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended October 31, 2020 of $182.2 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, which excluded non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Company's convertible senior notes and included the share impact of the convertible note hedge purchased by the Company, which is antidilutive for GAAP purposes. For the third quarter ended November 2, 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income on a non-GAAP basis of $44.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. Third quarter 2019 results exclude the gain on sale of subsidiaries, charges related to the exit of eight Field & Stream stores, and a non-cash asset impairment. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are included in a table later in the release under the heading ""GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations."" Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $2.41 billion, an increase of 22.9% compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by a 23.2% increase in consolidated same store sales and included an increase in eCommerce sales of 95%. eCommerce penetration for the third quarter of 2020 was approximately 21% of total net sales, compared to approximately 13% during the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter 2019 consolidated same store sales increased 6.0%.  ""We had another exceptionally strong quarter from both a sales and a profitability perspective. The strength of our diverse category portfolio once again helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand, as the positive trends across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle continued throughout Q3,"" said Edward W. Stack, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our performance in the quarter was driven by our 45,000 dedicated teammates who continued to work hard every day to safely serve our athletes and communities.""  Lauren R. Hobart, President, added, ""Our stores continue to be the hub of our industry-leading omni-channel platform and were the key to our unprecedented third quarter growth. Brick-and-mortar store comps grew double-digits, and our stores fulfilled approximately 70% of our online sales, which increased nearly 100% for the quarter. In fact, our stores drove 90% of our total Q3 sales growth, whether an athlete purchased at the register, picked up curbside or had their order delivered through ship-from-store. Data science and technology will continue to play an important role in creating a personalized, one-to-one relationship with our athletes, enabling us to serve them in the most convenient way possible."" Mr. Stack concluded, ""Overall, the favorable trends in our business have continued into Q4. These strong sales results have been partially offset by warmer weather that has negatively impacted sales in important cold-weather categories. Taken together, through the first three weeks of Q4, our consolidated comp sales have increased in the high-teens."" Balance Sheet The Company ended the third quarter of 2020 with nearly $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under its $1.855 billion revolving credit facility. In April, the Company issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes, which added over $500 million of net proceeds to its cash position. Total inventory decreased 9.8% at the end of the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-Date Results The Company reported consolidated net income for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 of $310.6 million, or $3.44 per diluted share. As a result of actions taken to prioritize the health and well-being of its teammates and athletes in response to COVID-19, the Company incurred approximately $124 million of pre-tax incremental teammate compensation and safety costs, or $1.01 per diluted share, net of tax, during the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020. For the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income of $227.6 million, or $2.53 per diluted share.  On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported consolidated net income for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 of $321.3 million, or $3.65 per diluted share, which excluded non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Company's convertible senior notes and included the share impact of the convertible note hedge purchased by the Company, which is antidilutive for GAAP purposes. For the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019, the Company reported consolidated net income on a non-GAAP basis of $215.8 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, which excludes the gain on sale of subsidiaries, non-cash asset impairments, charges related to the exit of eight Field & Stream stores, and the favorable settlement of a litigation contingency. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are included in a table later in the release under the heading ""GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations."" Net sales for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 increased 5.2% to approximately $6.46 billion. Despite temporary store closures during March, April and May to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, consolidated same store sales increased 5.8%. eCommerce sales increased 135%. eCommerce penetration for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2020 was approximately 28% of total net sales, compared to approximately 13% during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019. Consolidated same store sales increased 3.1% for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2019. Capital Allocation On November 20, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.3125 per share on the Company's Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

Full Year 2020 Outlook As previously announced on March 19, 2020, the Company withdrew its fiscal 2020 outlook. The Company is not providing an updated outlook at this time. Conference Call Info The Company will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter results. Investors will have the opportunity to listen to the earnings conference call over the internet through the Company's website located at investors.DICKS.com. To listen to the live call, please go to the website at least fifteen minutes early to register, download, and install any necessary audio software. For those who cannot listen to the live webcast, it will be archived on the Company's website for approximately twelve months. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting the Company's financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, and net capital expenditures, which management believes provides investors with useful supplemental information to evaluate the Company's ongoing operations and to compare with past and future periods. Management believes that excluding non-cash debt discount amortization from its convertible senior notes and including the share impact from the convertible note hedge is useful to investors because it provides a more complete view of the economics of the transaction. Management also uses certain non-GAAP measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, and measuring its operating performance. These measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below and on the Company's website at investors.DICKS.com. Fiscal 2020 Consolidated Same Store Sales Consolidated same store sales include stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19. The method of calculating consolidated same store sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculating this metric may not be the same as other retailers' methods. For additional information on consolidated same store sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward-looking statements normally contain words like ""believe"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""intend"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""may"", ""will"", ""should"", ""strategy"", ""future"" and similar expressions. By their nature, forward looking statements require the Corporation to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Corporation's business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that the Corporation believes are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. Important risks that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic such as health and safety, reduction and suspension of operations, global economic conditions, diversions of management attention, heightened IT risks, liquidity risks and credit risks, risks relating to the industry such as competition, business development and awarding of new contracts, level and timing of defence spending, government-funded defence and security programs, constraints within the civil aviation industry, regulatory matters, natural or other disasters, environmental laws and regulations, climate change, risks relating to CAE such as evolving standards and technology innovation, the Corporation's ability to penetrate new markets, R&D activities, fixed-price and long term supply contracts, strategic partnerships and long-term contracts, procurement and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) leverage, product integration and program management, protection of the Corporation's intellectual property and brand, third-party intellectual property, loss of key personnel, labour relations, liability risks that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance, warranty or other product-related claims, integration of acquired businesses through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or divestitures, reputational risk, U.S. foreign ownership, control or influence mitigation measures, length of sales cycle, seasonality, continued returns to shareholders, information technology and cybersecurity, the Corporation's reliance on technology and third party providers, data privacy, and risks relating to the market such as foreign exchange, availability of capital, credit risk, pension plan funding, doing business in foreign countries, geopolitical uncertainty, anti-corruption laws and taxation matters.

More information about the risks and uncertainties affecting CAE's business can be found in the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2020 and the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Any one or more of the factors described above and elsewhere in this press release, and in the documents referenced herein, may be exacerbated by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and may have a more negative impact on CAE's business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on CAE's forward-looking statements. Readers are also cautioned that the risks described above and elsewhere in this press release, and in the documents referenced herein, are not necessarily the only ones the Corporation faces; additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to the Corporation or that the Corporation may currently deem immaterial may adversely affect CAE's business. Except as required by law, the Corporation disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Material AssumptionsThe forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the anticipated negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the intended effect of mitigation measures implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CAE's available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on CAE's revolving credit facilities, the balance available under CAE's receivable purchase program, CAE's cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future; and no material financial, operational or competitive consequences of changes in regulations affecting CAE's business. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2020 and the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Given the impact of the changing circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the related response from CAE, governments, regulatory authorities, businesses and customers, there is inherently more uncertainty associated with CAE's assumptions. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this press release, and in the documents referenced herein, and, consequently, the forward-looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate.

"MONTREAL, Oct. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (Turquoise Hill or the Company) announced today that it is proceeding with the planned consolidation (or reverse stock-split) of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares at a ratio of one post-consolidation share for every ten pre-consolidation shares (the Consolidation). The Consolidation will be effective as of October 23, 2020. Notice has been provided to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and conditional approval to proceed with the Consolidation has been received from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Subject to the receipt of all required and final approvals, the Company's common shares are expected to begin trading on the NYSE and the TSX, on a consolidated basis, on or about October 26, 2020.  The Company's shareholders approved a special resolution at the Company's annual and special meeting of shareholders held on July 24, 2020, granting the board of directors authority, in its sole discretion, to implement the Consolidation and to select the exact consolidation ratio, provided that (i) the ratio be no smaller than one post-consolidation share for every five pre-consolidation shares and no larger than one post-consolidation share for every thirty pre-consolidation shares, and (ii) the number of pre-consolidation shares in the ratio be a whole number of common shares. The principal reason for implementing the Consolidation is to ensure that the Company's common shares remain eligible for continued listing on the NYSE. The NYSE's listing rules require that a listed security must have an average closing price of at least US$1.00 over a 30- day trading period in order to remain eligible for continued listing on the exchange. The Consolidation will reduce the number of issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from 2,012,314,469 shares to approximately 201,231,446 shares. Turquoise Hill's common shares will continue to trade on the NYSE and the TSX under the existing ticker symbols. Following the Consolidation, the new CUSIP number for the Company's common shares will be 900435207 and the new ISIN will be CA9004352071.  Proportionate adjustments will be made to the Company's outstanding performance share units, restricted share units and deferred share units. No fractional Common Shares will be issued pursuant to the Consolidation. Any and all such fractional shares will be aggregated and sold by the Company's transfer agent and registrar, AST Trust Company (Canada) (AST), on the market and in the event that the proceeds therefrom, net of brokerage commissions, expenses and withholding taxes, exceed US$5.00, such proceeds shall be paid to the relevant shareholders in proportion to their fractional entitlements. The Company is only responsible for dealing with fractions arising on registered holdings. For shareholders who hold their common shares through an intermediary (such as a securities broker, dealer, bank or other financial institution), the effect of the Consolidation on their individual holdings will be administered by the intermediary. Further details on the Consolidation are contained in the amended management information circular of the Company dated June 17, 2020, which has been filed and is available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.  AST will act as the exchange agent for the Consolidation. While a letter of transmittal was previously mailed to the Company's registered shareholders along with its proxy materials in March of 2020, a new letter of transmittal will be mailed to the Company's registered shareholders in respect of the Consolidation.  Registered shareholders will be required to send their certificate(s) representing pre-Consolidation common shares of the Company, along with a properly executed letter of transmittal, to AST in accordance with the instructions provided in the letter of transmittal. Shareholders who previously returned their certificates to AST with a properly executed letter of transmittal will not be required to take any further action with respect to the Consolidation. Shareholders who hold their common shares through a securities broker, dealer, bank or other financial institution will not be required to take any action with respect to the Consolidation and should contact that intermediary for their post-Consolidation positions. A copy of the new letter of transmittal will be available on the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and will also be posted on the Company's website at www.turquoisehill.com.

Forward-looking statements and information are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements or information. There can be no assurance that such statements or information will prove to be accurate. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies, local and global economic conditions, and the environment in which the Company will operate in the future, including the price of copper, gold and silver; projected gold, copper and silver grades; anticipated capital and operating costs, anticipated future production and cash flows; the anticipated location of certain infrastructure in Hugo North Lift 1; sequence of mining within and across panel boundaries; the availability and timing of required governmental and other approvals for the construction of the SOPP; the ability of the Government of Mongolia to finance and procure the SOPP within the timeframes anticipated in the PSFA, as amended; the willingness of third parties to extend existing power arrangements; the status of the Company's relationship and interaction with the Government of Mongolia on the continued operation and development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine and Oyu Tolgoi LLC internal governance; the status and nature of the Company's ongoing discussions with Rio Tinto plc and its subsidiaries with respect to future funding plans and requirements (including as contemplated by the MoU) as well as the completion and potential benefits of the Consolidation, the timing and anticipated effective date of the Consolidation and the date on which the common shares are expected to start trading on the NYSE and the TSX on a consolidated basis. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and information include, among others: copper, gold and silver price volatility; discrepancies between actual and estimated production; mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries; development plans for processing resources; the outcome of the Definitive Estimate review; public health crises such as COVID-19; matters relating to proposed exploration or expansion; mining operational and development risks, including geotechnical risks and ground conditions; litigation risks; regulatory restrictions (including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability); Oyu Tolgoi LLC or the Government of Mongolia's ability to deliver a domestic power source for the Oyu Tolgoi project within the required contractual time frame; communications with local stakeholders and community relations; activities, actions or assessments, including tax assessments, by governmental authorities; events or circumstances (including strikes, blockades or similar events outside of the Company's control) that may affect the Company's ability to deliver its products in a timely manner; currency fluctuations; the speculative nature of mineral exploration; the global economic climate; dilution; share price volatility; competition; loss of key employees; cyber security incidents; additional funding requirements, including in respect of the development or construction of a long-term domestic power supply for the Oyu Tolgoi project; capital and operating costs, including with respect to the development of additional deposits and processing facilities; and defective title to mineral claims or property. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. All such forward-looking statements and information are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company's management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. These statements, however, are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements or information.  With respect to forward-looking information concerning the continued operation and development of Oyu Tolgoi, the Company has based its assumptions and analyses on certain factors which are inherently uncertain. Uncertainties and assumptions include, among others: the timing and cost of the construction and expansion of mining and processing facilities; the timing and availability of a long-term domestic power source (or the availability of financing for the Company or the Government of Mongolia to construct such a source) for Oyu Tolgoi; the ability to secure and draw down on the supplemental debt under the Oyu Tolgoi project financing facility and the availability of additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to Oyu Tolgoi LLC, Rio Tinto and the Company to further develop Oyu Tolgoi as well as the status and nature of the Company's ongoing discussions with Rio Tinto plc and its subsidiaries with respect to future funding plans and requirements (including as contemplated by the MoU); the potential impact of COVID-19; the impact of changes in, changes in interpretation to or changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and government practices in Mongolia; the availability and cost of skilled labour and transportation; the obtaining of (and the terms and timing of obtaining) necessary environmental and other government approvals, consents and permits; delays, and the costs which would result from delays, in the development of the underground mine (which could significantly exceed the costs projected in OTTR20); projected copper, gold and silver prices and their market demand; and production estimates and the anticipated yearly production of copper, gold and silver at Oyu Tolgoi.  The cost, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of a property such as Oyu Tolgoi. It is common in mining operations and in the development or expansion of existing facilities to experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Additionally, although Oyu Tolgoi has achieved commercial production, there is no assurance that future development activities will result in profitable mining operations.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information or statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which contribute to the possibility that the predicted outcomes will not occur. Events or circumstances could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are included in the ""Risk Factors"" section in Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""AIF""), as supplemented by the ""Risks and Uncertainties"" section of the Company's second quarter 2020 management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") dated July 28, 2020. Readers are further cautioned that the list of factors enumerated in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the AIF and in the ""Risks and Uncertainties"" section of the Company's second quarter 2020 MD&A that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on the Company's forward-looking statements and information to make decisions with respect to the Company, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements and information contained herein are made as of the date of this document and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

"SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Expanse Inc., a leader in attack surface management. Under the terms of the agreement, Palo Alto Networks will acquire Expanse for a total purchase price of approximately $670 million to be paid in cash and stock and approximately $130 million in replacement equity awards, each such amount subject to adjustment. The proposed acquisition is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks fiscal second quarter, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. As companies embark on digital transformation, they often leave critical IT assets exposed to the internet, creating vulnerable points that attackers can exploit. This exposure has only accelerated with the rapid shift to the cloud and remote working.  Expanse's internet collection and attribution platform constantly monitors the global internet to map exposed and untracked assets that comprise customers' attack surfaces, evaluate and prioritize risk, and provide mitigation.

Separately, the Fund declared a special year-end distribution of $0.012 per share. The distributions are subject to the following ex-dividend, record and payment dates set by the Fund's Board of Trustees. December 2020 Declaration Tuesday, Dec. 1, 2020 Ex-Dividend Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2020 Record Thursday, Dec. 17, 2020 Payment Thursday, Dec. 31, 2020  This press release is not for tax reporting purposes. The press release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. For information on whether the distribution includes a return of capital, please contact us on or after the distribution payment date. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2021, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return. About DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek high current income; its secondary objective is to seek capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. DoubleLine Capital LP (""DoubleLine""), the Fund's investment adviser, expects that the Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets. The Fund may invest in mortgage-backed securities of any kind and may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as ""high yield"" securities or ""junk bonds""). There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss.

Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Investors should note that the Fund only can be obtained through a broker. This document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted. Fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with investment in the fund. Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a great risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decisions-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks.

"SAN DIEGO, July 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Biocept, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIOC), a leading commercial provider of molecular technologies designed to provide physicians with clinically actionable information to improve the outcomes of patients with cancer, announces that Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis) both have recommended that stockholders vote in favor of Biocept's proxy proposal to authorize a reverse stock split of Biocept's common stock, as further described in Biocept's Proxy Statement for its 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This item is Proposal 4 on the Biocept's proxy card (the ""Proposal""). ISS and Glass Lewis are two leading independent, third-party proxy advisory firms that, among other services, provide proxy voting recommendations to pension funds, investment managers, mutual funds and other institutional shareholders. Biocept's board of directors has recommended a vote FOR the Proposal, which will authorize Biocept's board of directors to amend Biocept's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of Biocept's common stock at a ratio in the range of 1:5 to 1:30, as determined by Biocept's board of directors. The reverse stock split proposal is intended to increase the per-share trading price of Biocept's common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq. Biocept's board believes that maintaining Biocept's Nasdaq listing may provide a broader market for Biocept's common stock than if Biocept's common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, and could help in generating interest in Biocept among investors. Biocept has until December 7, 2020 to satisfy the Nasdaq $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement. If Biocept has not regained compliance with the closing bid price requirement by that time, its common stock will be subject to delisting from Nasdaq.   Voting on the Proposal will be open through the conclusion of Biocept's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will reconvene on July 31, 2020 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. Biocept stockholders as of April 20, 2020, the record date for the Annual Meeting, are invited to attend the reconvened virtual Annual Meeting by registering at https://www.proxydocs.com/branding/964314/edocs/2020/issuer/. The deadline to register is July 29, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.

"HOPKINTON, Mass., Nov. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Please replace the release dated November 19, 2020 with the following corrected version due to revisions to the headline. The corrected release reads: HOPKINTON, MA, Nov. 19, 2020 – Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBPH) (""Spring Bank""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for oncology and inflammatory diseases, announced that at its special meeting of stockholders held earlier today, Spring Bank's stockholders approved the issuance of shares of Spring Bank common stock to holders of share capital of F-star Therapeutics Limited (""F-star"") in connection with its proposed combination with F-star (the ""Exchange"").  In connection with the Exchange, stockholders also approved a proposal to effect a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of Spring Bank common stock at a reverse stock split ratio as mutually agreed to be Spring Bank and F-star in the range of one new share for every three to seven shares outstanding (or any number in between).   Spring Bank and F-star have agreed that the exchange ratio for the reverse stock split will be one for every four shares of Spring Bank common stock outstanding (the ""Reverse Stock Split"").  The Reverse Stock Split will be effective for trading purposes as of the commencement of trading on Monday, November 23, 2020.  At the special meeting, Spring Bank stockholders also approved a change of the corporate name of Spring Bank from ""Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc."" to ""F-star Therapeutics, Inc."" effective upon closing of the Exchange.  It is anticipated that the closing of the Exchange will occur on November 20, 2020. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Spring Bank's common stock immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be reduced into a smaller number of shares, such that every 4 shares of Spring Bank's common stock held by a stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be combined and reclassified into one share of Spring Bank's common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of pre-split shares not evenly divisible by the number of pre-split shares for which each post-split share is to be reclassified, will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the product of such fraction to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the closing price of Spring Bank's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the last trading day prior to the Reverse Stock Split effective time (as adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split), rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the total number of authorized shares of Spring Bank common stock.

These statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition, or otherwise, based on current beliefs of the management of Spring Bank or F-star as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management of Spring Bank and F-star. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- PREIT (NYSE: PEI), a leading operator of diverse retail and experiential destinations, today announced that it has reached an agreement with more than 80% of its bank lenders under which the banks would provide an additional $150 million to recapitalize the business and extend the Company's debt maturity schedule, supporting PREIT's operations and the continued execution of its strategic priorities.  ""Long before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we began taking meaningful actions to enhance the financial and operational health of the business,"" said Joseph F. Coradino, CEO of PREIT.  ""These steps have included proactive asset sales, anchor repositioning and redevelopment to significantly minimize our exposure to underperforming assets, as well as, diversifying our tenant base to provide mass-market offerings appealing to shoppers while simultaneously improving the Company's underlying tenant credit profile. The next phase in our evolution is continuing on the path we have charted to create diverse multi-use ecosystems at our properties marked by a healthy mix of multifamily housing, healthcare services, fulfillment centers, and other uses alongside our robust retail, dining and entertainment lineups. We appreciate the support of our bank lending group, and their collective confidence in our portfolio and the progress we are making in positioning PREIT for long-term success. This agreement provides us with the liquidity to compete effectively, meet our obligations, and continue providing our tenants, customers and communities with the high-quality shopping experience they expect at our properties."" Under the terms of the agreement, PREIT would have access to $150 million in new capital to strengthen the business and provide financial flexibility. Specifically, the banks will convert the Company's existing credit facilities into a $150 million first lien senior secured facility, a $919 million facility consisting of a first lien senior secured term loan facility and a second lien secured term loan facility all of which will have a two-year term with a 1-year extension option.  The Company's current pool of unencumbered assets will serve as collateral for the facility and the Company will retain 30% of proceeds from non-income producing asset sales.  The agreement remains subject to finalization of definitive documentation and the approval of 100 percent of the bank group. The Company is working toward completing this process before the end of October. If the Company is unable to secure the support of the remaining lenders holding less than 20% of the debt, it may need to complete this restructuring through a prepackaged reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The purpose of such a process, if necessary, would be to implement the agreement that already has the support of over 80% of the Company's bank lenders. As such, the Company expects that any prepackaged reorganization process would be expedited, and that it would have no impact on shareholders, suppliers and other trade creditors, business partners, or other stakeholders, all of whom would be unimpaired.  The Company will continue operating as normal with a primary focus on the health and safety of its employees, partners, customers and communities.  Coradino concluded, ""Given the significant support we have already received from a substantial majority of our lenders, we are confident in our ability to implement the recapitalization agreement quickly and efficiently. We appreciate the support of our bank lenders, tenants, and customers, and above all, we are grateful for the continued dedication of our relentless team of associates at PREIT.  We are excited to take another big step forward in positioning PREIT for an even more successful future.""

Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that can be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""intend,"" ""may"" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans, strategies, anticipated events, trends and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future events and conditions and are based on currently available financial, economic and competitive data and our current business plans. Actual results could vary materially depending on risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that may affect our operations, markets, services, prices and other factors as discussed in the Risk Factors section of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements as it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement (the ""RSA"") we have entered into; risks attendant to the bankruptcy process, including our ability to obtain court approvals with respect to motions filed in the chapter 11 cases contemplated by the RSA (the ""Chapter 11 Cases""), the outcomes of court rulings and the Chapter 11 Cases in general and the length of time that we may be required to operate in bankruptcy; the effectiveness of the overall restructuring activities pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases and any additional strategies that we may employ to address our liquidity and capital resources; the actions and decisions of creditors, regulators and other third parties that have an interest in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; restrictions on us due to the terms of any debtor-in-possession credit facility that we will enter into in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and restrictions imposed by the applicable courts; our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue and pro forma leverage ratio and generate free cash flow to further reduce our indebtedness; our ability to manage our business through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakening of global economic and financial conditions, changes in governmental regulations and related compliance and litigation costs and the other factors listed in our SEC filings. Additionally, our business might be materially and adversely affected by changes in the retail and real estate industries, including consolidation and store closings, particularly among anchor tenants; current economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to reduce its spread, and the corresponding effects on tenant business performance, prospects, solvency and leasing decisions; our inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; our ability to maintain and increase property occupancy, sales and rental rates; increases in operating costs that cannot be passed on to tenants; the effects of online shopping and other uses of technology on our retail tenants; risks related to our development and redevelopment activities, including delays, cost overruns and our inability to reach projected occupancy or rental rates; acts of violence at malls, including our properties, or at other similar spaces, and the potential effect on traffic and sales; our ability to sell properties that we seek to dispose of or our ability to obtain prices we seek; our substantial debt and the liquidation preference of our preferred shares and our high leverage ratio and our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants under our debt facilities; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, on favorable terms or at all; our ability to raise capital, including through sales of properties or interests in properties and through the issuance of equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable; and potential dilution from any capital raising transactions or other equity issuances. Additional factors that might cause future events, achievements or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements include those discussed herein, and in the sections entitled ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020.

"Boralex becomes the sole owner of 3 Quebec wind farms, with a 296 MW installed capacity MONTREAL, Nov. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - Boralex Inc. (""Boralex"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSX: BLX) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the full 49% equity stake held by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (""CDPQ"") in 3 wind farms in Quebec, already 51% owned by Boralex. CDPQ's 49% equity stake represents 145 MW net installed capacity and the three wind farms represent a total capacity of 296 MW. Located in the Avignon RCM in Gaspésie and the Appalaches RCM in eastern Quebec, these farms are equipped with Enercon turbines and benefit from long-term power purchase agreements (""PPAs"") with Hydro-Québec Distribution, expiring between 2032 and 2033 with a weighted average remaining contract duration of nearly 12.5 years. ""We're very pleased to announce our acquisition of CDPQ's stake in high-quality wind farms that we already own 51% of and have managed for over two years following our acquisition of Invenergy's stakes in these assets. Operating these wind farms provided the expected synergies and has yielded results 10% better than we had expected in 2019"", says Patrick Lemaire, Boralex's President and CEO. ""This transaction strengthens our position in the wind industry in Canada and is perfectly aligned with the growth orientation of our strategic plan. Acquiring CDPQ's stake will add significant cash flow for the coming years and a positive contribution to the company's discretionary cash flow per share in the first year after the transaction closes. We also expect to generate additional operational and financial synergies in the coming years,"" adds Patrick Decostre, Boralex's Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. As part of the acquisition, Boralex will pay a cash consideration of $121.5 million to CDPQ on closing, which may be supplemented by a conditional consideration of up to $4 million subject to the settlement of certain future conditions that need to be met. The closing is expected to take place at the end of November 2020, subject to standard closing conditions. Following this transaction, Boralex's installed capacity will be 2,212 MW. Highlights Wind farm descriptionDes Moulins I wind farm (136 MW) is located in the Appalaches RCM in Quebec. This farm has 59 E-82 wind turbines. Des Moulins II wind farm (21 MW) is located in the Avignon RCM in Gaspésie, Quebec. This farm has nine E-92 wind turbines. Both farms are covered by an existing PPA that expires in December 2033. Le Plateau I wind farm (139 MW) is located in the Avignon RCM in Gaspésie, Quebec. This park has 60 E-70 E4 wind turbines and is covered by an existing PPA that expires in March 2032. Each wind farm is funded on a long-term basis through consortiums of international financial institutions. Financing consists of a combination of variable interest rate term loans (a large portion of which is covered by interest rate swaps) and notes or fixed rate loans. Project debt as at September 30, 2020, totalled $402 million (the 49% equity stake is therefore $197 million). Questions relating to related party transactionsCDPQ holds approximately 17.28% of the Corporation's issued and outstanding common shares as at November 20, 2020. The acquisition could be considered a ""related party transaction"" under MI 61-101 for the Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (MI 61–101). The Corporation has availed itself of the exceptions for evaluation and approval of minority holders in paragraphs 5.5(a) and 5.7(a) in MI 61-101. The two independent directors representing CDPQ on the Boralex board of directors did not participate in the discussions on the acquisition, and they abstained from voting on these matters.

In accordance with Delaware law, each of the Charter Amendments became effective immediately upon filing. As a result of the Charter Amendments and as a matter of law, a stockholder owning fewer than 50 shares of common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split (the ""Reverse Stock Split Effective Time""), which occurred on March 19, 2020 at 6:51 P.M. EDT, became entitled to a fraction of a share of common stock upon the Reverse Stock Split and is entitled to be paid cash in lieu of such fraction of a share of common stock, on the basis of $30.00, without interest (the ""Cash Payment""), for each share of common stock held by such holder (the ""Cashed Out Stockholders"") immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split Effective Time. Original Process In consultation with DTC and Equiniti Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, the Company established a process whereby Cashed Out Stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" through a bank, broker or other nominee (each, a ""Nominee"") must complete and send a form (the ""Original Form"") to Equiniti in order to establish that such Cashed Out Stockholder held fewer than 50 shares immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split Effective Time. The Original Form was made available to Nominees through DTC on June 22, 2020. Alternative Process in Light of COVID-19 Based upon feedback, the Company is now providing an alternative process to accommodate Cashed Out Stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" who are experiencing challenges in completing the Original Form in light of COVID-19.  Among other changes to accommodate such stockholders, the process has been revised so that stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" are not required to submit the Original Form or any other paperwork if their Nominee is taking advantage of the new process and completes a new form (the ""New Form"") which is available to Nominees through DTC's LENS System.  Additionally, the deadline for Nominees to submit this New Form has been extended from July 20, 2020 to no later than 5:00 P.M., prevailing New York City time on July 31, 2020 (note however that there is no change to the DTC instruction deadline of July 20, 2020 for Nominees to deliver shares).  Next Steps for Cashed Out Stockholders As noted above, the Company has designed this alternative process in light of the challenges presented by COVID-19 so that Nominees taking advantage of this alternative process can fill out the New Form on behalf of its clients. As a result, the Company will not require that Cashed Out Stockholders holding shares in ""street name"" submit the Old Form or any other paperwork.  Cashed Out Stockholders who own shares directly as a ""holder of record"" will receive the Cash Payment as soon as reasonably practicable following the Expiration Time.

"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --  Legal-Bay, The Pre Settlement Funding Company, announces the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of The Diocese of Rockville Centre in Long Island—a suburb of New York City—in response to a torrent of lawsuits brought forth by numerous victims. The bankruptcy declaration is the U.S.'s largest ever filed by a Roman Catholic church, and the 3rd in New York State after Buffalo's and Rochester's filings. The state of New York recently suspended their statute of limitations, giving victims an extended period to file lawsuits over sexual abuse by priests. Chris Janish, CEO of Legal-Bay, commented, ""Legal-Bay has always been an advocate for plaintiffs in clergy sexual abuse cases, and has continued to fund some of the litigations even while dioceses declare bankruptcy.  The current filing follows a strategy now being employed by many organizations—including the Boy Scouts of America—to thwart paying damages. It remains to be seen if this will ultimately be beneficial or harmful to the victims who have suffered.""   If you have been or know a victim of any type of sexual assault or harassment and need an immediate cash advance, please visit Legal-Bay HERE or call toll-free at 877.571.0405. Aside from sexual abuse loans for settlements, Legal-Bay also provides settlement loan funding for all types of cases including personal injury, car accident, medical malpractice, judgment on appeal, commercial litigation, and more. Their loans for lawsuits have helped numerous plaintiffs through many a financial crisis.   Legal-Bay's loan settlement programs provide immediate cash in advance of a plaintiff's anticipated monetary award. The non-recourse law suit ""loans"" —sometimes referred to as loans for lawsuit or loans on settlement—are risk-free, as the money doesn't need to be repaid should the recipient lose their case. Therefore, the lawsuit loan isn't really a loan, but rather a cash advance.  To apply now, please visit us HERE or call toll-free at: 877.571.0405 where agents are standing by.

The Company expects to use the time and legal protections made available through the Chapter 11 process to continue discussions with financial stakeholders, as well as critical conversations with its landlords, to achieve a comprehensive balance sheet restructuring that supports its re-opening and longer-term strategic plans. CEC franchised locations operate under separate legal and financial structures and are not included in the Chapter 11 filings. As of June 24, 266 company-operated Chuck E Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza restaurant and arcade venues had safely re-opened, in accordance with all CDC, federal, state and local guidelines. Subject to ongoing negotiations with its landlords, the Company expects to maintain ongoing operations in these locations throughout the Chapter 11 process, providing dine-in, delivery and carry-out services, hosting birthday parties during dedicated hours, and supporting fundraisers and events in the coming weeks and months. The Company also plans to continue opening additional locations each week, steadily bringing more employees back to work.  ""The Chapter 11 process will allow us to strengthen our financial structure as we recover from what has undoubtedly been the most challenging event in our Company's history and get back to the business of delivering memories, entertainment, and pizzas for another 40 years and beyond,"" said David McKillips, CEC's Chief Executive Officer. ""I am incredibly proud of what the CEC team has achieved over the past year as we launched the All You Can Play value gaming platform, expanded our remodel program and found new ways to engage with families while our venues were closed. I'm confident in the strength of our team and our world-class brands and look forward to more fully implementing our strategic plan as we put these financial challenges behind us."" The Company has filed customary motions with the Bankruptcy Court intended to allow CEC to maintain operations in the ordinary course including, but not limited to, paying employees and continuing existing benefits programs, honoring guest gift cards, and upholding commitments under its franchising and licensing agreements. The motions are typical in the Chapter 11 process and CEC anticipates that they will be heard and approved in the first few days of the Chapter 11 cases. CEC's Chapter 11 cases will be heard in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.

"PHILADELPHIA, June 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- FS KKR Capital Corp. (NYSE: FSK), a leading publicly traded business development company focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies, announced that it expects to implement a reverse stock split, to be effective on or around June 15, 2020, which was approved by the board of directors of the Company on May 26, 2020. As a result of the reverse stock split, the share count will be reduced on a 4 : 1 basis, such that each shareholder will receive 1 share for every 4 shares owned. The Company also intends to file a separate Articles of Amendment to its charter to provide that there will be no change in the par value of $0.001 per share as a result of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split is expected to be effective for trading purposes on June 16, 2020.  There is not expected to be any direct economic consequence to the Company or its shareholders from the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will not change the authorized number of shares of the Company's common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all shareholders uniformly and will not alter any shareholder's percentage interest in the Company's equity, except to the extent that the reverse stock split would result in some shareholders owning a fractional share. In that regard, no fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse split. Shareholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive a cash payment based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the effective date of the amendment to the Company's charter effecting the reverse stock split. As previously disclosed, the Company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.15 per share, which will be paid on or about July 2, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2020.

"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases, in an all cash transaction for approximately $6.5 billion.  This acquisition provides an opportunity for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson to broaden its leadership in immune-mediated diseases and drive further growth through expansion into autoantibody-driven disease. The transaction will include full global rights to nipocalimab (M281), a clinically validated, potentially best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody. Nipocalimab gives Janssen the opportunity to reach significantly more patients by pursuing indications across many autoimmune diseases with substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Nipocalimab recently received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Momenta's expertise in FcRn mechanisms is especially important for nipocalimab as it supports and accelerates the development of a medicine designed to target a number of autoantibody-driven conditions across several of Janssen's established therapeutic areas. Janssen expects nipocalimab to contribute to its goals of achieving above-market growth over the mid and long term. Autoimmune diseases driven partially or completely by autoantibodies represent a novel area where Janssen can significantly improve health outcomes for patients. In autoantibody-driven diseases, the body's antibodies attack or damage its own proteins, cells and tissues, often with devastating consequences. Autoantibody-driven diseases include Myasthenia Gravis, Hemolytic Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn, warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, and other serious dermatologic, rheumatic, neurologic, hematologic and renal diseases. An estimated 2.5 percent of the population, or approximately 195 million people worldwide, suffer from some form of autoantibody-driven disease, many of which are orphan and rare diseases. With competitively differentiated, parallel development programs and full worldwide commercial rights for nipocalimab, Janssen will have the potential to introduce multiple  launches, many as first-in-class indications with potential for significant peak year sales, some of which could exceed $1 billion, supporting Janssen's goal of continuing to deliver above-market performance over the long term.  ""This acquisition broadens Janssen's leadership in autoimmune diseases and provides us with a major catalyst for sustained growth. Autoantibody-driven diseases are often serious, and patients are underserved by current treatment options,"" said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson. ""We're excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care by combining Johnson & Johnson's world-class R&D, commercial and supply chain capabilities with Momenta's talented people, pipeline and deep expertise in this important area."" In addition to Momenta's employees and lead asset nipocalimab, Janssen will acquire Momenta's pipeline of clinical and pre-clinical assets. The acquisition was driven by the significant opportunity seen in nipocalimab, along with the scientific capability Janssen is acquiring with the Momenta team. Janssen's plans for additional assets in the Momenta pipeline will be determined as more data become available and could offer further upside potential. ""Nipocalimab, and the rest of Momenta's pipeline, built over many years by outstanding scientists who have turned important insights into actionable biology, expands and complements our portfolio by giving us clinical-stage and discovery-stage compounds in autoantibody biological pathways. Combining Momenta's discoveries with our 20-year heritage in immunology, global scope, and scientific and medical expertise, we see a real opportunity to create an entire 'pipeline in a pathway,'"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head of Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. ""We are excited about the significant potential to expand on Momenta's excellent progress in rare diseases, and to increase our impact on patients both within and beyond our current focus areas."" Janssen plans to retain Momenta's presence in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This site will increase Johnson & Johnson's existing innovation footprint and capabilities in the greater Boston area given Momenta's talented scientists, suite of proprietary technologies, sophisticated laboratories and proximity to top talent in this innovation hub.  About the AgreementUnder the terms of the transaction, which was approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Vigor Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (the Company), will commence a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Momenta for $52.50 per share. The closing of the offer is conditioned on the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Momenta's common stock on a fully diluted basis, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The $6.1 billion estimated net value of the transaction is based on Momenta's estimated fully diluted shares outstanding, less estimated net cash at time of closing. Assuming the closing of the tender offer, the Company will acquire any shares of Momenta not tendered into the tender offer through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Momenta for the same per share consideration as will be payable in the tender offer. The merger will be effected as soon as practicable after the closing of the tender offer. Following completion of the merger, Momenta's common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. While the closing of the transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive, the Company is maintaining its current 2020 Adjusted EPSi guidance range. Looking ahead, the costs associated with the development of Momenta's portfolio are expected to be incremental to planned R&D investment levels over the next few years given the value creation potential of our current portfolio, and thus expect this incremental investment in R&D to have an EPS impact worth approximately $0.10-$0.15 in 2021. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination. About Janssen's Approach to Autoimmune DiseaseJanssen has pioneered breakthrough science in autoimmune diseases with five approved therapies to treat more than 30 pediatric and adult indications. Significant unmet need remains, since many autoimmune diseases have few or no approved treatments, and only a small fraction of those living with autoimmune disease ever achieve sustained clinical remission. Janssen pursues research and development in both functional manifestations of disease (disease area strongholds) and biological pathways (pathway area strongholds). Biological pathways identify mechanisms through which seemingly dissimilar diseases can be connected by genetic, molecular or cellular systems in the body. It is now understood that multiple, diverse autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need are linked by the same immune pathways.  Janssen's pathways-centric strategy opens the door to fully develop compounds for multiple diseases sharing a common pathway, thus challenging the concept of one drug for one disease. In addition, as scientific understanding of the immune system expands, there is increasing recognition of its impact on more diseases than previously understood.

Having said that, we are pleased to be in discussions with interested bidders for our cementing business and for certain portions of our fracturing business and technology."" The Company is developing a plan with its stakeholders to minimize disruption to current client activity as much as feasible and will be reaching out to clients to discuss available options.

""I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to our employees for their tireless commitment to the Company, and to our clients, suppliers and other business partners for their continued support during these challenging times,"" Mr. Zemlak added. ""I want to assure our business partners that our team is as focused as ever on working with our stakeholders to procure sufficient liquidity to complete all client activities safely and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.""

"TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Libbey Inc. (OTC: LBYYQ) (""Libbey"" or the ""Company""), one of the world's largest glass tableware manufacturers, filed an Amended Plan of Reorganization (the ""Plan"") and a related Disclosure Statement today in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (""the Court""). The Plan outlines the Company's proposal to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce debt and improve liquidity in order to emerge from bankruptcy as a financially stronger company.   As contemplated under the terms of the Plan, Libbey has received a term sheet from seven of its lenders to provide $150 million in exit financing, which net of lender fees and repayment of the Company's existing debtor-in-possession (""DIP"") financing will provide $75 million of incremental funding for the Company's exit from bankruptcy and go-forward operations. Libbey also expects to replace its $100 million DIP revolving credit facility with a new exit facility with approximately $20 million initially drawn. Overall, Libbey expects to emerge from the Chapter 11 process with less than $200 million of funded debt, compared to more than $400 million of debt that existed at the beginning of the court-supervised process.  Additionally, as required under the terms of the Plan, Libbey today filed motions with the Court to modify its collective bargaining agreements (""CBAs"") and certain union-related retiree benefits. If approved by the Court, the motions will modify the CBAs for Libbey employees represented by the United Steelworkers and the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers. Under the terms of the Company's proposals to the unions, Libbey is seeking to modify wages, certain benefits (including freezing future benefit accruals under its hourly defined benefit pension plan) and certain work rules for its U.S. union employees. In addition to these proposed modifications, the Company has also taken actions to reduce its salaried headcount and the wage and benefit costs relating to its salaried employees, as well as non-salary related costs. All of these actions, including the proposed modifications to the Company's CBAs and certain union-related retiree benefit obligations, provide cost reductions that are essential to the Company's successful reorganization.  As part of optimizing its manufacturing capacity, Libbey has committed to its previously announced plan to close its manufacturing facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The Company intends to cease production by the end of 2020, with full closure to be completed by the second half of 2022. Libbey continues to negotiate with the United Steelworkers representing the Company's employees regarding the effects of the facility closure. Mike Bauer, chief executive officer of Libbey, said, ""We continue to make important progress and are on a path to complete our restructuring later this year. While we recognize the impact of the proposed modifications to the CBAs for our union employees and union retirees, we believe the changes are essential to ensure our successful emergence from Chapter 11. The cost savings and operational improvements they will help us achieve will preserve approximately 1,200 U.S. jobs and make Libbey a stronger company going forward. We remain committed to continuing good-faith negotiations with our unions throughout this process.""   Mr. Bauer continued, ""As we take the final steps in this court-supervised process, we continue to serve customers and end users globally. As always, we remain focused on providing the high-quality products, service and community commitment that define Libbey. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their continued hard work and dedication, as well as all our stakeholders for their continued support."" A Court hearing to consider approval of the Disclosure Statement related to the Plan is scheduled for August 21, 2020. Following Court approval of the Disclosure Statement, Libbey will distribute the Plan and Disclosure Statement to voting creditors for their consideration. This press release is not intended as a solicitation for a vote on the Plan. Any such solicitation will be made pursuant to and in accordance with the Disclosure Statement and applicable law, including orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan and Disclosure Statement contain or discuss certain financial projections and analysis (collectively, ""Projections and Analysis""). The Projections and Analysis are based on estimates and assumptions that may not materialize, were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the guidelines established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and should not be relied upon to make an investment decision with respect to the Company. The Projections and Analysis do not purport to present the Company's financial condition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and have not been examined or compiled by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

Neiman Marcus Group Receives Court Approval to Access Debtor-In-Possession Financing Facility",bankruptcy
"WILMINGTON, Del., Aug. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Takata Tort Compensation Trust Fund has taken legal action against one of Takata's Japanese insurance companies, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., to enforce Takata's Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization and Confirmation Order and recover money for hundreds of US victims injured or killed by Takata's defective exploding airbag inflators.  The motion marks the first legal action by the Trust against Takata's Japan-based insurers in connection with Takata's defective airbag inflators. The motion, filed in the bankruptcy proceedings of Takata Corporation's U.S.-based subsidiaries, asserts that Tokio, which issued products liability policies insuring Takata pre-bankruptcy, has repudiated the Delaware Bankruptcy Court Plan's transfer of Takata's rights under those policies to the Trust solely to avoid its coverage obligations and reap a windfall from Takata's bankruptcy.  Tokio was paid millions of dollars in premiums by the defunct airbag manufacturer before it pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges and filed for bankruptcy, and the Trust's motion asserts that the insurance proceeds are supposed to be there to compensate Takata's personal injury and wrongful death victims. As detailed in the motion, the Plan established the Trust to process and pay claims of victims who were injured or killed by airbags manufactured and sold by Takata.  The Plan contemplated that the Trust would be funded, potentially in large part, by the rights and proceeds of Takata's products liability insurance policies.  Accordingly, the Plan transferred Takata's rights under all policies potentially applicable to the victims' claims to the Trust as of the Plan's effective date. The insurance rights transfer provision was the product of intense negotiations by Takata and its victims to reach swift resolution of a large and complex bankruptcy and to ensure that victims received prompt and reasonable compensation.  Upon confirmation of the Plan in February 2017, the judge presiding over the bankruptcy proceedings praised the efforts of everyone involved, noting the amount of work necessary to reach a largely consensual agreement in such a complex case so quickly. Due to the Trust's limited existing assets to pay claims, to date the victims of Takata's products have recovered only a fraction of the value of their claims.  Tokio has now asserted, to the victims' detriment, that it has no obligations to provide coverage for the claims under its policies—despite the fact that Tokio had been paying for such claims against Takata prior to the bankruptcy. In its motion filed earlier today, the Trust asks the Bankruptcy Court to order Tokio to comply with the Plan's insurance rights transfer provision by acknowledging that the Trust is the holder of Takata's rights under the Tokio policies, and to sanction Tokio for its violation of the Court's Order, including reimbursing the Trust for the legal costs of making the motion. Professor Eric D. Green, The Trustee of the Takata Airbag Tort Compensation Trust Fund, reported that the Trust was forced to take this legal action ""because of Tokio's absolute refusal to abide by the express assignment of insurance rights to the Trust under the bankruptcy plan.""  ""Takata's reckless behavior in making this timebomb and putting it in people's cars as a supposed safety device was bad enough,"" Professor Green said, ""but now, adding insult to injury, Takata's Japanese insurer is refusing to honor its obligations under its policies and as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.  It is a dishonorable and surprising attack on these victims in the United States who have been wounded and maimed by Tokio's insured's conduct.  We will fight to make things right,"" Professor Green said. The Takata Tort Compensation Trust Fund is represented in the matter by Gilbert LLP, as lead counsel, and Brown Rudnick LLP as co-counsel.

"GERMANTOWN, Md., Aug. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Limited to the following proposals: Scheduled to Reconvene September 4, 2020, 2:00 pm Eastern Time Seneca Biopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNCA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel treatments for diseases of high unmet medical need, announced that its 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that convened on August 7, 2020 has been adjourned until September 4, 2020 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time in order to solicit additional proxies for Proposal 3, Proposal 4, and Proposal 7 as described above. Proposals 1, 2, 5, and 6 are completed and no further voting is necessary. The adjourned meeting will be a completely ""virtual"" meeting of stockholders, and stockholders will be able to listen and participate in the virtual annual meeting as well as vote during the live webcast of the meeting by visiting https://web.lumiagm.com/273873368 (Please see instructions below). At the Annual Meeting, only 67.90% of outstanding shares participated in the meeting.  This is significantly less participation than the 2019 Annual Meeting where approximately 80.5% of shares were represented. The Board believes this may be as a result of COVID-19 and inclement weather on the eastern coast of the United States. Accordingly, the Board determined that reconvening the 2020 Annual Meeting until September 4, 2020 was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board of Directors believes approval of Proposal 3 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders because there may be some uncertainty as to the effectiveness of the vote obtained at the 2019 Annual Meeting, and ratifying the filing and effectiveness of the amendment to our certificate of incorporation which effected the 1-for-20 reverse stock split and the effectiveness of 1-for-20 reverse stock split itself, pursuant to Section 204 of the DGCL to eliminate any uncertainty regarding their effectiveness. Proposal 3 is described in more detail in the Company's proxy statement dated June 24, 2020, furnished to stockholders in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting. We have seen significant stockholder support for Proposal 3. At the time of the meeting, approximately 68.18% of the shares that had been voted on Proposal 3 were voted in its favor. However, the favorable votes were less than the absolute majority of all outstanding shares, which is required for approval of this proposal.  The Board of Directors believes approval of Proposal 4 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders because the Board believes that a reverse stock split, at the discretion of the Board could (i) improve the marketability and liquidity of the Company's common stock and (2) the Company may need to effect a reverse stock split in order to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 550(a)(2), as the Company's minimum bird price was below $1.00 for thirty (30) consecutive business days pursuant to a letter received from The Nasdaq Stock Market on March 10, 2020. The Company has until December 10, 2020 to regain compliance through the Company's common stock having a closing bid price meeting or exceeding $1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days.  We have seen significant stockholder support for Proposal 4. At the time of the meeting, approximately 57.18% of the shares that had been voted on Proposal 4 were voted in its favor. However, the favorable votes were less than the absolute majority of all outstanding shares, which is required for approval of this proposal.  The Board of Directors believes approval of Proposal 7 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders in order for the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have seen significant stockholder support for Proposal 7. At the time of the meeting, approximately 43.15% of the shares that had been voted on Proposal 7 were voted in its favor. However, the favorable votes were less than the majority of shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which is required for approval of this proposal.  The Company encourages any stockholder that has not yet voted its shares on Proposals 3, 4, or 7, or is uncertain if their shares have been voted on any of the foregoing Proposals to contact their broker or bank. The Board of Directors and management respectfully request stockholders as of the record date, June 19, 2020, to please vote their proxies as soon as possible, but no later than September 3, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time). Stockholders who have previously submitted their proxy or otherwise voted for the annual meeting and who do not want to change their vote need not take any action. For questions relating to the voting of shares or to request additional or misplaced proxy voting materials, please contact the Company's proxy advisory group at [email protected], (866) 619-8915. INSTRUCTIONS TO VOTE As described in the proxy statement, a stockholder may use one of the following simple methods to vote before the September 4, 2020 adjourned meeting with respect to Proposals 3, 4, and 7: If your shares are registered in your name, then you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with proxy materials from American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (""AST"").  If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, go to https://web.lumiagm.com/273873368 and input the 11-digit control number found on your card previously received.  The password for the meeting is seneca2020.   If your shares are registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you are the ""beneficial owner"" of those shares you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with proxy materials from that organization rather than directly from AST.

Subject to the fulfillment, in each case, of certain milestones, covenants and conditions precedent agreed with the DIP Lenders, (i) upon the date of entry of an order by the Court granting interim approval of the DIP Facility and fulfillment of other conditions, up to US$100 million of the Tranche 1 DIP Loans will be made available; and (ii) upon the date of entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court granting final approval of the DIP Facility and fulfillment of other conditions, the undrawn portion of the Tranche 1 facility will be available in a single draw, and the Tranche 2 DIP Loans will be made available in an initial draw of US$175 million, and, subject to the fulfilment of certain additional conditions and milestones, subsequent draws in minimum amounts of US$100 million. The DIP Facility, which is still subject to the Bankruptcy Court approval, the execution of definitive credit and ancillary agreements, and the fulfillment of certain conditions for funding of the separate two tranches, will provide us with liquidity to meet our future obligations in a timely and orderly fashion, and to continue with our operations during and after the voluntary restructuring process. The Tranche 2 DIP Facility, may be converted, at the lenders' option, into shares of reorganized Aeromexico, provided that the exercise of such equity conversion option will be subject to certain conditions and, in due course, to the corporate and regulatory approvals for the issuance of the corresponding shares including by Aeromexico's general shareholders.  The terms of the DIP Facility require that Aeromexico enters into a Shareholder Support Agreement with a majority of its shareholders, representing approximately 75% of its capital stock, including Delta Airlines, under which such supporting shareholders (i) shall vote, in due course, in favor of a capital increase to effectuate, if applicable, the conversion of the Tranche 2 DIP Facility, including waiving their preemptive rights, (ii) submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the scope and terms of such Shareholders Support Agreement, and (iii) agree not to sell their shares during the chapter 11 process. It is anticipated that with the capital increase these shareholders will be diluted by not exercising their preemptive rights, so that their remaining equity stake could be very limited. Other shareholders within the general investor community will be allowed to exercise their preemptive rights subject to several factors that are yet to be determined. As we have reported, certain Board members, are holders, individually, of shares representing more than 1% and less than 10% of our outstanding shares. None of our shareholders, individually, has significant influence, control or power over Aeromexico. Also, we are not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a foreign individual, entity or government. Pursuant to the Mexican Ley del Mercado de Valores (Securities Market Law) this type of shareholders agreements shall be disclosed to the public market, making it available for reference at the Company's offices. We will continue pursuing, in an orderly manner the voluntary process of financial restructuring under the chapter 11 process, while we continue operating and offering services to our customers and contracting from our suppliers the goods and services required for operations. We will continue to use the advantages of the chapter 11 proceeding to strengthen our financial position and liquidity, protect and preserve our operations and assets, and implement the necessary adjustments to face the impact of COVID-19.

Mr. Ziv Turner, Chairman and CEO comments: ""Through the  company's unique and innovative products, which are supported by clinical studies and results, OWC is poised to drive significant changes in the MMJ market. Our top priorities now are to generate revenues by selling those products and seeking strategic partners or transactions with participants in the US cannabis market - currently the largest MMJ market in the world. In order to achieve these goals we need to raise funds from new investors. With no authorized share capital available, the Reverse Split is a critical move for us.""  ""We have developed a roadmap for the next two years and will provide a description in the near future"", added Turner.

I recently  rejoined the company to seek to advance my strong, long held belief in medical grade cannabis based solutions for patients.

"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 1, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- PREIT (NYSE: PEI), a leading operator of diverse retail and experiential destinations, today announced it has taken the next step to execute its prepackaged financial restructuring plan (the ""Prepackaged Plan"") under which the Company will be recapitalized and its debt maturities extended. Consistent with the Company's previously announced Restructuring Support Agreement (the ""RSA""), PREIT has filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to implement its Prepackaged Plan.  As previously announced on October 14, 2020, PREIT entered into the RSA with its bank lenders. The banks have committed to provide an additional $150 million to recapitalize the business and extend the Company's debt maturity schedule, supporting PREIT's operations and the continued execution of its strategic priorities. Subsequent to executing the RSA, PREIT solicited acceptances of its Prepackaged Plan, which received overwhelming support from 95% of its creditors.   The filing will ensure that PREIT can continue all business operations without interruption while it obtains necessary approvals of its financial restructuring plan. The Company's primary focus remains creating compelling retail and experiential destinations while prioritizing the health and safety of its employees, partners, customers and communities.  ""We are pleased to be moving forward with strengthening the Company's balance sheet and positioning it for long-term success through our prepackaged plan. We are grateful for the significant support we have received from a substantial majority of our lenders, which we expect will enable us to complete our financial restructuring on an expedited basis,"" said Joseph F. Coradino, CEO of PREIT. ""Today's announcement has no impact on our operations – our employees, tenants, vendors and the communities we serve –and we remain committed to continuing to deliver top-tier experiences and improving our portfolio. With the overwhelming support of our lenders, we look forward to quickly emerging from this process as a financially stronger company with the resources and support to continue creating diverse, multi-use ecosystems throughout our portfolio."" Not only will PREIT pay all vendors, suppliers and employees during the course of the Chapter 11, but  pursuant to the terms of the Prepackaged Plan, which will also be subject to court approval, the prepetition claims of suppliers and other trade creditors and business partners will be unimpaired. The financial restructuring is not expected to have any impact on the Company's shareholders, and PREIT common and preferred shares are expected to continue to trade in the normal course. PREIT has filed a number of customary first day motions with the court to support its operations during the court-supervised process, including the continued payment of employee wages and benefits without interruption. The Company expects to receive court approval for these requests. Additional information, including court documents and information about the court-supervised process, is available on PREIT's restructuring website through PREIT's claims agent, Prime Clerk at https://cases.primeclerk.com/PREIT.   DLA Piper LLP (US) LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are serving as legal counsel and PJT Partners LP is serving as financial advisor to PREIT.

Additionally, our business might be materially and adversely affected by changes in the retail and real estate industries, including consolidation and store closings, particularly among anchor tenants; current economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to reduce its spread, and the corresponding effects on tenant business performance, prospects, solvency and leasing decisions; our inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; our ability to maintain and increase property occupancy, sales and rental rates; increases in operating costs that cannot be passed on to tenants; the effects of online shopping and other uses of technology on our retail tenants; risks related to our development and redevelopment activities, including delays, cost overruns and our inability to reach projected occupancy or rental rates; acts of violence at malls, including our properties, or at other similar spaces, and the potential effect on traffic and sales; our ability to sell properties that we seek to dispose of or our ability to obtain prices we seek; our substantial debt and the liquidation preference of our preferred shares and our high leverage ratio and our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants under our debt facilities; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, on favorable terms or at all; our ability to raise capital, including through sales of properties or interests in properties and through the issuance of equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable; and potential dilution from any capital raising transactions or other equity issuances.

"MELVILLE, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- A&G Real Estate Partners today announced that it has completed bankruptcy court-approved sales of Stage Stores, Inc.'s Jacksonville, Texas distribution center and two other properties to two buyers. The Melville, N.Y.-based A&G has been serving as real estate advisor for the Houston-headquartered retailer, which operated 738 conventional department stores and off-price stores under multiple brands at the time it filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in May 2020. The company has since liquidated all stores. 
In the largest transaction, Bradenton, Fla.-based Bealls Inc. acquired the fee interest for Stage's 435,196-square-foot distribution center in Jacksonville, which sits on a 42.51-acre parcel that includes undeveloped land for expansion. The facility was built in 1985 and has undergone multiple rounds of modernization to accommodate brick-and-mortar and e-commerce fulfillment.
 In the largest transaction, Bradenton, Fla.-based Bealls Inc. acquired the fee interest for Stage's 435,196-square-foot distribution center in Jacksonville, which sits on a 42.51-acre parcel that includes undeveloped land for expansion. The facility was built in 1985 and has undergone multiple rounds of modernization to accommodate brick-and-mortar and e-commerce fulfillment. Apart from the real estate, Bealls' winning $7.0 million bid included the facility's machinery and equipment, and the company's intellectual property.  A&G also sold two other sites owned by Stage Stores: an income producing industrial RTV (return to vendor ) center in Jacksonville and a retail site in Logan, West Virginia. Both were acquired by Jetall Companies, Inc., a real estate investment and management firm out of Houston.  Located on 6.45 acres, the 125,232-square-foot RTV center is currently partially occupied by a single tenant. The 24,332-square-foot retail property is a single-level former Peebles store on Stratton Street in downtown Logan.  ""Jetall purchased the two properties for a combined $360,000, which was $100,000 higher than the other bids presented to the court,"" said Mike Matlat, Senior Managing Director at A&G.  A&G put the three properties up for bid in early August. ""We ran an accelerated sales process that delivered winning bids which were accepted by the court without any objections from the creditors,"" noted Matlat. "" Overall, we were especially pleased to see the Jacksonville distribution center transition on a turnkey basis to an expansion-minded retailer that will utilize this state-of-the-art facility to support its growth."" The family-owned Bealls Inc. currently operates more than 540 stores in 17 states under the Bealls, Bealls Outlet, Burkes Outlet, Home Centric and Bunulu names, and online at beallsflorida.com and burkesoutlet.com.  The intellectual property acquired by Bealls Inc. from the court includes the trademarks and trade names for Stage Stores, Goody's, Gordmans, Palais Royal, and Peebles, as well as the national rights for the Bealls name. In addition, Bealls acquired all of Stage's private label brands and customer lists.  Commenting on their acquisition, Matt Beall, CEO and Executive Chairman of Bealls Inc., said: ""We are very excited about this transaction for many reasons. The distribution center will allow us to gain additional merchandise processing capacity to support our expansion efforts. This is our first owned logistics facility located outside of the state of Florida. With our Burke's Outlet chain expanding throughout the U.S., it is important that we shore up our foundation to support this growth.""  ""We are also excited to now own the national rights to the Bealls name,"" he continued.  ""While Beall's Inc. had rights to use the name Beall's in Florida, Georgia and Arizona, Stage had previously owned the rights to use the name nationally. We believe that this will reduce confusion and create opportunities for us as we look to further grow our store and e-commerce presence.""

"NEW YORK, Nov. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- AIkido Pharma Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""AIkido"") (NASDAQ: AIKI) today announced the results from the virtual 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ""Meeting"") held on November 17, 2020 (the ""Meeting""). All proposals that were presented to the stockholders were approved at the Meeting, except for the proposal to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock (the ""Common Stock"") at a ratio of up to one-for-ten (the ""Amendment Proposal""). Accordingly, the Company adjourned the Meeting to allow more time for stockholders to consider the Amendment Proposal.  The adjournment of the Meeting will preserve the September 24, 2020 record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the upcoming adjourned meeting to be held at 12:00 p.m. on December 4, 2020. The detailed voting results for the Meeting are provided in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on November 20, 2020. The Company urges all stockholders who have not yet voted to vote in favor of the Amendment Proposal. Approval of the Amendment Proposal and the resulting reverse stock split is critical.  The primary objective of the reverse stock split is to raise the per share trading price of the Common Stock to comply with the Nasdaq minimum share price listing rule to allow the Company to continue to list on Nasdaq.  The higher stock price resulting from the reverse stock split and the listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq is important for the marketability of the Common Stock to the financial community and investing public.  If the reverse stock split is not effectuated, it could limit the number of potential buyers of the Common Stock as many institutional investors have policies prohibiting them from holding lower-priced stocks in their portfolios.  Also, brokerage houses frequently have internal practices and policies that discourage individual brokers from dealing in lower-priced stocks.  Top proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, who together provide voting recommendations on stockholder meetings to a majority of institutional stockholders, both recommend a ""FOR"" vote for this proposal in order to maintain listing on Nasdaq. We urge you to please vote your shares of AIkido today.  You may do so by contacting MacKenzie Partners at 1-800-322-2885 (toll-free in the U.S.) or 212-929-5500.

Actual results could vary materially depending on risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that may affect our operations, markets, services, prices and other factors as discussed in the Risk Factors section of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements as it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the ability to implement a restructuring of our indebtedness on an out-of-court basis in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement (the ""RSA"") we have entered into; the ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization in accordance with the terms of the RSA; risks attendant to the bankruptcy process, including our ability to obtain court approvals with respect to motions filed in the chapter 11 cases contemplated by the RSA (the ""Chapter 11 Cases""), the outcomes of court rulings and the Chapter 11 Cases in general and the length of time that we may be required to operate in bankruptcy; the effectiveness of the overall restructuring activities pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases and any additional strategies that we may employ to address our liquidity and capital resources; the actions and decisions of creditors, regulators and other third parties that have an interest in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; restrictions on us due to the terms of any debtor-in-possession credit facility that we will enter into in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and restrictions imposed by the applicable courts; our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue and pro forma leverage ratio and generate free cash flow to further reduce our indebtedness; our ability to manage our business through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakening of global economic and financial conditions, changes in governmental regulations and related compliance and litigation costs and the other factors listed in our SEC filings. Additionally, our business might be materially and adversely affected by changes in the retail and real estate industries, including consolidation and store closings, particularly among anchor tenants; current economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to reduce its spread, and the corresponding effects on tenant business performance, prospects, solvency and leasing decisions; our inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; our ability to maintain and increase property occupancy, sales and rental rates; increases in operating costs that cannot be passed on to tenants; the effects of online shopping and other uses of technology on our retail tenants; risks related to our development and redevelopment activities, including delays, cost overruns and our inability to reach projected occupancy or rental rates; acts of violence at malls, including our properties, or at other similar spaces, and the potential effect on traffic and sales; our ability to sell properties that we seek to dispose of or our ability to obtain prices we seek; our substantial debt and the liquidation preference of our preferred shares and our high leverage ratio and our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants under our debt facilities; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, on favorable terms or at all; our ability to raise capital, including through sales of properties or interests in properties and through the issuance of equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable; and potential dilution from any capital raising transactions or other equity issuances.

(OTC: LBYYQ) (""Libbey"" or the ""Company""), one of the world's largest glass tableware manufacturers, today announced a tentative plan to close its manufacturing facility in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the Company continues to take actions to reduce costs and align manufacturing capacity with lower levels of projected demand. Libbey will negotiate this recommendation further with the unions representing its employees prior to finalizing a decision.  Mike Bauer, chief executive officer of Libbey, said, ""Over the last few years, we have experienced declining demand in our core markets, which has contributed to overcapacity. This has been exacerbated by COVID-19. The recommendation to close our facility in Shreveport will better align our cost structure with current and expected customer demand as we position Libbey for the future. If the closure occurs, we will leverage our existing U.S. and international manufacturing footprint, along with our best-in-class sourcing capabilities, to continue to provide industry-leading service to our customers and end users."" He continued, ""Although difficult, we believe this is a necessary step in transforming Libbey for success in the post-COVID-19 era, and we recognize the impact it could have on our 450 employees in Shreveport, their families and the communities in which we operate. We will work constructively with the unions representing Libbey employees and will keep all stakeholders informed as we consider our final decision about our continued operations.""  This tentative plan, if implemented, would wind down Libbey's manufacturing operations in Shreveport by the end of 2020. The Company's distribution center in Greenwood, Louisiana, is not impacted by this announcement and will remain open.

"LOS ANGELES, June 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) (""CIIX"" or ""the Company""), an established financial news and investment portal, and a leading industrial hemp retailer for the Chinese-speaking community, today announced that it has commenced a voluntary restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. The Chapter 11 filing provides immediate protection to the Company, which allows the Company to reorganize its debts during this time of financial strain. The Company will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business as it pursues approval of the restructuring plan. The Company Continues to Operate as Usual Serving its Clients ""This restructuring is a necessary and positive step forward for the business;"" says CEO Warren Wang. Wang continued, ""ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. remains a strong operating company and we are making every effort to ensure that the Company is able to operate as usual throughout this process. We are privileged to serve the global Chinese community and are committed to continuing to provide up-to-date investment news, information and education to our loyal subscribers and top-notch service to our investor relations clients seeking exposure in the Chinese speaking investment community. We are extremely grateful to all of our stakeholders, subscribers, vendors, investors, and employees who have contributed to our legacy, 20 years in the making. We look forward to the continued success long into the future."" Strong Earnings and Revenue Momentum Despite Global Challenges In the past year the global economy has been affected by geopolitical tensions between the US and China, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. With offices in both the US and China, the Company felt the effects of both of these challenges. Although the global economy is slowly opening up in recent weeks, during most of 2020, the world's population was quarantined to their home necessarily. Most Americans will continue to work from home through the end of 2020, or even indefinitely. As a result of the majority of the world being homebound, for many months there has been a significant increase in online investing. With this in mind, the Company's management pivoted and seized the opportunity for more focused engagement with its audience. This change in the investment environment, coupled with Mr. Wang's unique ability to engage the Chinese speaking investment community, has led to record subscription revenues in recent months. Taking Action to Reorganize its Capital Structure As part of its restructuring plan, the Company has identified more efficient ways to monetize its revenue streams by turning to YouTube and other social media outlets, allowing it to reach a large Chinese audience and generate significant revenues with little to no advertising costs. Moreover, in an effort to stabilize operating cash flow, prior to implementing this digital programming, in 2019, the Company had begun scaling down its labor force significantly for both its cryptocurrency and industrial hemp lines, which in turn led to downsizing the Company's physical office presence, and to refocus its business and marketing plans. Reducing the Company's Current Debt through the Chapter 11 Process will Position the Company for Future Success Although the Company has made a significant upturn in subscription revenues in the past few months by strategically refocusing its marketing and pursuing cost-cutting measures, after extensive evaluation and consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Company has determined that reorganizing the Company's debt structure is essential to its future success. Restructuring through Chapter 11 will enable the Company to reduce its debt and interest expense, while providing increased financial flexibility to support ongoing operations. Although the Company is not at present in a position to repay its outstanding debt, by converting its existing debt to equity, shareholders will be in a position to participate in the continued growth of the public Company as we reorganize, recover and prosper. Going forward, the Company is committed to seeking out more innovative and cost-efficient opportunities to reach its intended audience, grow its customer base and maximize profits. First Day Motions As part of the reorganization process, the Company will file customary ""First Day"" motions, which should allow it to maintain operations in the ordinary course. Again, the Company intends to continue to provide the same quality news, information, education and investor relations services without interruption; to pay vendors and suppliers under customary terms for services received on or after the filing date, and to pay its employees in the usual manner and to continue their primary benefits without disruption.

Butterfly iQ is the only transducer using semiconductor technology that can perform ""whole-body imaging"" using a single handheld probe. Connected to a mobile phone or tablet, it is powered by Butterfly's proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology and harnesses the advantages of AI to deliver advanced imaging that they believe is easy to use, improves patient outcomes and lowers cost of care.

Butterfly iQ is designed to address the limitations of currently-available cart-based and POCUS technologies. Butterfly iQ was launched commercially in 2018, and in 2020, the Company launched the Butterfly iQ+ with additional features and improved performance. Since introduction, more than 30,000 Butterfly iQ and iQ+ devices have shipped to medical professionals globally. The Company has sold to or has agreements in place with the majority of the largest 100 hospitals in the United States, and has built a strong brand among healthcare professionals, achieving an exceptional Net Promoter Score of 71 (USA). Butterfly iQ is commercially available in more than 20 countries including the United States, Canada, greater Europe and Australia.  Butterfly was founded by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg, a scientist and serial entrepreneur who received the Presidential Medal of Technology & Innovation in 2016 for inventing a novel next-generation DNA sequencing method.

Additionally, the Company has the support of its term loan lenders and secured note holders to backstop a $600 million rights offering upon exit.    Doug Lawler, Chesapeake's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We are fundamentally resetting Chesapeake's capital structure and business to address our legacy financial weaknesses and capitalize on our substantial operational strengths. By eliminating approximately $7 billion of debt and addressing the legacy contractual obligations that have hindered our performance, we are positioning Chesapeake to capitalize on our diverse operating platform and proven track record of improving capital and operating efficiencies and technical excellence. With these demonstrated strengths, and the benefit of an appropriately sized capital structure, Chesapeake will be uniquely positioned to emerge from the Chapter 11 process as a stronger and more competitive enterprise."" Lawler added, ""In addition to securing financing to fund our ongoing operations and facilitate our exit from this process, we are pleased to have the support of our term loan lenders and secured note holders to backstop a $600 million rights offering, demonstrating their confidence in Chesapeake's operating platform and future. We deeply appreciate the hard work and commitment of our employees, who remain focused on safely and efficiently executing our business. We look forward to working productively with our suppliers, business partners and all stakeholders throughout this process.""  Lawler concluded, ""Over the last several years, our dedicated employees have transformed Chesapeake's business — improving capital efficiency and operational performance, eliminating costs, reducing debt and diversifying our portfolio. Despite having removed over $20 billion of leverage and financial commitments, we believe this restructuring is necessary for the long-term success and value creation of the business."" Chesapeake has filed customary motions with the Court seeking a variety of ""first-day"" relief, including authority to pay owner royalties, employee wages and benefits, and certain vendors and suppliers in the ordinary course for goods and services provided.

"JUNO BEACH, Fla., Sept. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today announced that, based on the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and the continued execution across all of its businesses, it is increasing its financial expectations for 2021 and 2022 and is extending its longer-term growth outlook to 2023. For 2021, NextEra Energy is increasing its financial expectations ranges by $0.20 and now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10.15. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8%, off the expected increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share. ""The increase and extension of our financial expectations is a reflection of NextEra Energy's continued strong performance across all of its businesses and our belief that we remain as well-positioned as ever with excellent prospects for growth,"" said Jim Robo, NextEra Energy chairman and chief executive officer. ""The market for low-cost renewables continues to rapidly expand, and we believe our best-in-class development skills leave us uniquely positioned to capitalize on these significant investment opportunities. As a result of the strength and diversity of NextEra Energy's underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020, 2021, 2022, and now 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings and, most importantly, continuing to reliably deliver for our customers. We have a long-standing track record of delivering value for our shareholders and remain focused on delivering on all of our commitments going forward."" In addition, the NextEra Energy board of directors has approved a four-for-one split of NextEra Energy common stock, which is intended to make stock ownership more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record on Oct. 19, 2020, will receive three additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, to be distributed on Oct. 26, 2020. Trading will begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on Oct. 27, 2020. As a result of the four-for-one stock split, NextEra Energy is updating its adjusted earnings per share financial expectations ranges to reflect the increase in outstanding shares. In 2020, the company now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.30. For 2021, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54, reflecting today's announced increase in the financial expectations as a result of the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8%, off the expected increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share. For 2022 and 2023, this translates to a range of $2.55 to $2.75 and $2.77 to $2.97, respectively. NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards; the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and OTTI, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the effects of NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains; gains on disposal of a business; differential membership interests-related; and acquisition-related expenses. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no divestitures other than to NextEra Energy Partners, LP or acquisitions; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives.

Antengene offered 154,153,500 shares in its global offering at a final price of HK$18.08 per share. The net proceeds from the global offering, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions paid and payable in connection with the global offering and estimated expenses, are estimated to be approximately HK$2,635,9 million. The company's Hong Kong public offering was significantly oversubscribed, with valid applications received representing approximately 246.76 times the total number of offer shares initially available for subscription, and the international offering oversubscribed by 13.5 times. The final number of offer shares under the Hong Kong public offering and the international offering was 77,077,000 and 77,076,500, respectively, each representing approximately 50% of the total number of offer shares initially available for subscription under the global offering prior to the exercise of any over-allotment option.

Currently, Antengene has built an innovative pipeline of 12 assets . One of the core products, ATG-010 (selinexor, US trade name XPOVIO®), is the first and only selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) of its kind, which can promote the accumulation of tumor suppressor protein in the cell nucleus and selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The product has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and its Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of patients with liposarcoma met its primary study endpoint reporting a significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). Currently, Antengene is conducting a Phase II clinical trial of ATG-010 (selinexor) for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in China, and plans to submit new drug applications for ATG-010 (selinexor) in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong China, Taiwan China, Australia, Singapore, South Korea by 2021.

"FORT WORTH, Texas, June 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Vista Proppants and Logistics, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Vista"" or the ""Company""), announced today that they have commenced cases for a voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division.  The Company intends to use the reorganization cases to restructure debt from its balance sheet, substantially deleveraging Vista's capital structure and positioning the Company for long-term success given the current significantly depressed industry environment.  The Company currently estimates that it will emerge from the Chapter 11 reorganization within approximately 120 days, and fully expects to operate as normal when the oil and gas industry rebounds.    The Company also announced it has secured an $11 million debtor-in-possession credit facility (the ""DIP Facility"") from the Company's senior lenders to finance the costs and limited business operations during the restructuring process, including meeting obligations to employees, vendors and other constituencies.  The Company's senior lenders are fully-supportive of the bankruptcy filings and expect to sponsor a plan of reorganization with Vista to facilitate a prompt exit from Chapter 11.   Chief Financial Officer Kristin Whitley Smith commented: ""Today's Chapter 11 filings represent a significant milestone in our financial restructuring process to significantly strengthen our financial condition by reducing debt, enhancing liquidity and best positioning our Company to weather the storm and proactively respond when the market begins to recover.  After thoroughly evaluating our options and strategic alternatives with our advisors and Board of Directors, we are confident that this is the best path forward for Vista and our stakeholders.  During the reorganization proceeding, we will continue with limited day-to-day operations until an industry rebound, and we will maintain ample liquidity and resources to support our business.  We appreciate the continued, strong support demonstrated by our lenders, which should enable us to move quickly and smoothly through the restructuring process and emerge as a stronger long-term competitor.""   The voluntary chapter 11 petitions were filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division.  The Company has retained Alvarez & Marsal North America, LLC as its Chief Restructuring Officer and Haynes and Boone, LLP as its bankruptcy counsel.

(""Mantaro""), a private British Columbian company, whereby Yuntone will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mantaro  (the ""Transaction"").  Mantaro holds a 100% interest in the following five silver-focused Peruvian mineral properties, consisting of its flagship; Santas Gloria Silver and the San Jose Silver Properties as well as the La Purisima, Cerro Luque and Huaranay Properties (the ""Silver Properties""). As part of the Transaction, Mantaro will carry out a subscription receipt financing for gross proceeds of $5,000,000. Yuntone is a capital pool company (""CPC"") and intends the Transaction to constitute a Qualifying Transaction under the TSX Venture Exchange (the ""Exchange"") Policy 2.4 – Capital Pool Companies.  Upon successful completion of the Transaction, Yuntone will be a Tier 2 mining issuer. Highlights of Transaction: ""We have been able to attract a world-renowned advisory team in Mr. Craig Angus and Dr. Quinton Hennigh, which speaks to the true potential of this company.  A geological field team is presently conducting an extensive geochemical sampling program in conjunction with remapping of accessible historic underground workings. We are rapidly identifying high value drill targets and intend to be drill ready early next year. San Jose and Santas Gloria are key foundation silver-dominant projects, on which we hope to build a wider project portfolio. I am excited to be a part of a unique silver company in what I think is the start of a promising silver bull market"" states Dr. Christopher Wilson.   The Transaction Under the terms of the Definitive Agreement, Yuntone has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mantaro, which holds a 100% interest in the Silver Properties, and, in consideration of which, Yuntone will issue to the shareholders of Mantaro one post-Consolidation share of Yuntone for every share held of Mantaro.  All outstanding convertible securities of Mantaro, including share purchase warrants and stock options, will be exchanged or replaced with convertible securities of Yuntone based on a one-to-one basis and on the same economic terms and conditions as previously issued.  Upon completion of the Transaction, Mantaro will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yuntone. Yuntone will complete a share consolidation on the basis of two pre-consolidation common share of Yuntone for every one post-consolidation common share of Yuntone (the ""Consolidation"").  As a result of the Consolidation, Yuntone's issued and outstanding shares will change from 16,356,710 pre-Consolidation shares to 8,178,535 post-Consolidation shares.  Yuntone also plans to change its name to ""Mantaro Silver Corp."" and list the common shares under a new stock symbol. Mantaro currently has 25,239,000 common shares issued and outstanding and 5,907,000 share purchase warrants exercisable at $0.35 per share for a period of one year from the date of issue. Upon closing of the Transaction and the Offering, Yuntone anticipates it will have 47,703,249 common shares issued and outstanding and 13,049,857 share purchase warrants issued and outstanding. The Transaction is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval, shareholder approval of Mantaro, completion of the Offering and other customer conditions for the Transaction. The Transaction will constitute an arm's-length transaction, and as such will not require approval by the shareholders of Yuntone. Yuntone is preparing and will submit a filing statement in connection with the Transaction in due course.  Financial information of Mantaro will be set forth in a subsequent news release and in the filing statement to be filed on www.sedar.com. Private Placement Financing Mantaro is also pleased to announce that it will carry out a private placement financing of 14,285,714 subscription receipts (the ""Subscription Receipts"") at a price of $0.35 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (the ""Offering"").  Each Subscription Receipt, prior to the closing of the Transaction, will automatically convert into one common share of Mantaro and one-half of one share purchase warrant of Mantaro (each a ""Mantaro Warrant""), with each whole Mantaro Warrant exercisable into one common share of Mantaro at an exercise price of $0.55 per share for a period of one year, for no additional consideration upon the satisfaction of certain escrow release conditions, including the conditional approval of the Exchange for the Transaction and satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the Transaction as set out in the Definitive Agreement. The proceeds of the Offering will be used for the exploration and drilling on the Silver Properties and working capital over the next twelve months. About Mantaro Silver Corp. Mantaro Silver Corp. is a British Columbia company that holds a 100% interest in its two flagship silver properties, Santas Gloria Silver and San Jose Silver Properties, as well as a 100% interest in the La Purisima, Cerro Luque and Huaranay Properties. Santas Gloria Silver Property The Santas Gloria Silver Property is 100% owned by Mantaro. It comprises of three mineral concessions totaling 1,100 hectares and is located 55 kilometers directly east of Lima. Silver is the main target commodity at Santas Gloria.  Historic surface sampling reported grades of over 400 oz/t Ag from bonanza shoots.  Combined lead and zinc values range from 2% to 20% in the high-grade silver zones. Information derived from report on Santas Gloria Mining Project by Dr. Alberto Rios Carranza (2020). There are over 10 kilometers of intermediate sulphidation veins arranged into three key target zones: Tembladera, Elaine and Santa Cruz.  The system has never been drilled tested and exploitation of silver was limited to two areas of the San Jorge and Tembladera veins.   Historical production of silver has been carried out on Santas Gloria since colonial times.  To date, an estimated 4 kilometers of underground workings have exploited 2 of the 22 veins at Santas Gloria.  In 2005 and 2006, the San Jorge and Tembladera veins were worked on six levels.  Santas Gloria is permitted for 30 tonne per day extraction.  A small processing plant at site produced silver concentrates with reported silver recoveries of 85%-90%.  Information derived from report on Santas Gloria Mining Project by Dr. Alberto Rios Carranza (2020). Santas Gloria has agreements and permissions from the local community for exploration and mining work until 2028 and there are currently no environmental issues on the project. Santas Gloria is a silver-base metal vein system otherwise known as Cordilleran silver-base metal type.  These deposits have many similarities to intermediate sulphidation vein systems.  Such deposits are attractive exploration targets due to their often high-grade nature and the large vertical extent of precious and base metal endowment. Under the terms of its underlying agreement to acquire Santas Gloria, Mantaro is required to pay the former property owners US $50,000 per month over the next four months and incur a total of US $1,500,000 in exploration expenditures (US $500,000 by October 2021 and US $1,000,000 by October 2022) on the Santas Gloria Silver Property.  Mantaro will also pay a one-time discovery bonus of US $1,000,000 upon announcement of a resource estimate of 10,000,000 ounces Ag equivalent on the Santas Gloria Property. Mantaro is currently conducting an extensive geological mapping and geochemical sampling program at Santas Gloria. Channel samples of vein exposures in accessible underground workings and vein outcrop has been completed over the entire license holding. Grid soil sampling of potential vein extensions beneath shallow cover is ongoing.  Upon completion of the Transaction, Mantaro intends to carry out an initial 5,000 meters of diamond drilling, from underground and surface locations. Some remediation of historic underground workings will be required, primarily replacement of timbers that have rotted. Drifting on the vein and drilling from new cross-cuts, should provide the most accurate targeting of high-grade silver mineralization, on the San Jorge and Tembladera Veins.  Other veins will be drilled from surface with a focus on the more gold-rich silver-base metals veins in the north of the concession San Jose Silver Property The San Jose Silver Property is 100% owned by Mantaro, comprised of five concessions totaling 3,300 hectares and located 180 kilometers directly north of Lima.   Silver is the main target commodity at San Jose.  There are over 12 kilometers of veins and inferred strike extensions of veins.  The veins are divided into four target zones: San Jose vein, El Sarco vein, UTCAS 1 vein and UTCAS 2 vein. *Information derived from Pan American Silver Internal Report (2018), titled Reporte De Reconocimiento Geologico, ""Proyecto – Mina San Jose, Cajatambo"". From 2013 to 2018, a small scale underground mine was operation on the San Jose vein.  An estimated 42,000 tonnes of material was extracted with reported silver grades between 15 to 20 ounces per tonne.  Production exploited approximately 200 meters of the western margin of San Jose on four levels.  *Information derived from Pan American Silver Internal Report (2018), titled Reporte De Reconocimiento Geologico, ""Proyecto – Mina San Jose, Cajatambo"". Under the terms of its underlying agreement to acquire San Jose, Mantaro will be required to pay and issue to the former property owners of the four of the five concessions that comprise the San Jose Silver Property: (i) US $90,000 in July 2021, (ii) US $140,000 in July 2022, (iii) US $150,000 in July 2023, (iv) 375,000 shares and 125,000 on listing with the Exchange, and (v) 375,000 shares and 125,000 warrants on six months after listing on the Exchange.  Mantaro is also required to incur a total of US $150,000 in exploration expenditures on the San Jose Property by July 2023.  Four of the five concessions of the San Jose Silver Property are subject to a 2% Net Smelter Return Royalty, of which Mantaro may repurchase each 1% Net Smelter Return Royalty with a payment of US $750,000 (ie. US $1,500,000 for the entire 2% Net Smelter Return Royalty). Upon completion of the Transaction, Mantaro will focus on detailed geological mapping and geochemical sampling of all veins and inferred vein extensions. This work will provide a much better understanding of key controls on mineralization and allow for most effective drill targeting. La Purisima, Cerro Luque and Huaranay Properties The La Purisima, Cerro Luque and Huaranay Properties are 100% owned by Mantaro, by way of staking, and are located in northwest Peru.  The La Purisima Property covers 1,075 hectares and reported historical assays of up to 8 ounces per tonne Ag and 2.5 grams per tonne Au.  The Cerro Luque Property covers 1,650 hectares, contains multiple historic adits within its alterations system and reported historic assays of 11 ounces per tonne Ag.  The Huaranay Property covers 2,000 hectares and includes two gold prospects (Corrales and Chinchango).  It also has a historic silver mine with reported grades of up to 37 ounces per tonne Ag.  Historical information has been derived from the Geological Mining and Metallurgical Institute in Peru from reports dated 1979 to 1985.

"BARTLETT, Ill., June 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The majority bondholders for the Clare Oaks retirement community today shared their plans to keep residents in their homes and protect the senior citizens' financial investments in the continuing care retirement community.  Clare Oaks filed for bankruptcy in 2019, the second time they have taken such an action.  Certain funds managed by Lapis Advisers, LP and Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., filed a chapter 11 plan of reorganization in US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division to restructure the financially challenged Clare Oaks community.  They laid out their restructuring plan (the Bondholders Plan) for the continued operation of Clare Oaks with minimal disruption to the residents. Equally important, the Bondholders Plan, according to court documents ""repositions Clare Oaks on a solid path of financial stability and future growth"" and according to the majority bondholders, is the only feasible plan that can accomplish that goal.  The Bondholders Plan and all filings are available at https://case.stretto.com/clareoaks. Highlights of the Bondholders Plan are as follows:  The additional funds will be used for important health and life safety improvements at Clare Oaks. They will also help to convert half of Clare Oaks' underutilized skilled nursing beds into more desired assisted living units. These units will meet community needs and improve the financial outlook for Clare Oaks.   The Bondholders Plan will bring in an independent professional management company.  The chosen firm will have experience acquiring and managing financially challenged senior living communities such as Clare Oaks.   ""We are excited to bring about a successful management change for Clare Oaks and its residents.  We believe in this non-profit community and intend to invest substantial additional funds,"" said Kjerstin Hatch, a principal with Lapis Advisers, LP. ""We are disappointed that current management has chosen to put forth misleading and inflammatory statements with regards to our restructuring plan and encourage all constituents to read our disclosure statement and plan once it has been approved by the judge for dissemination.""   Lapis has a successful track record of turning around underperforming continuing care retirement communities and will select a management company which demonstrates the same type of success. Lapis wants to insure that the current residents live with substantially the same or better contract terms and services after bankruptcy and never have to go through this process again. Not only does the Bondholders Plan provide for financial stability at Clare Oaks, it also proposes only one modification to the residency agreement for consenting independent living residents.  It will guarantee that when an independent living resident leaves their unit, even if they stay at the community through a higher level of care, he or she will receive their refund once a new resident pays an entrance fee and occupies that unit.  This one modification to residency agreements is considered best practice and is consistent with the practice of the majority of continuing care retirement communities offering an entrance fee model.

"CHESTERFIELD, Mo., Dec. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Reliv International, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELV), a developer and marketer of nutritional supplements that promote optimal health, today announced an update to its plan to suspend its obligations to file periodic and current reports and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") and to delist its common stock from trading on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange as previously announced in a press release on October 19, 2020. December 21, 2020 will be the effective date of the Company's 1-for-2,000 reverse stock split (the ""Reverse Split"") of its Common Stock followed immediately by a 2,000 for 1 forward stock split (the ""Forward Split"") of its Common Stock (collectively the ""Stock Split"").  The Stock Split was previously approved by written consent of holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding Common Stock.  Interests in fractional shares owned by stockholders owning fewer than 2,000 shares of Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $3.75 per share owned by such stockholders prior to the Reverse Split. However, if a registered stockholder holds 2,000 or more shares of Common Stock in its account immediately prior to the Effective Date of the Reverse Split, any fractional share in such account resulting from the Reverse Split will not be cashed out and the total number of shares held by such holder will not change as a result of the Stock Split. On December 4, 2020, the Company notified NASDAQ of the Company's intent to voluntarily delist its common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market. On or about December 21, 2020, the Company intends to file with NASDAQ and the Commission a Form 25 relating to the delisting of its common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market. It is anticipated that trading of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market will be suspended the day after the filing of the Form 25, and the delisting will become effective ten days after the filing date of the Form 25.  The Company expects its common stock to be quoted and traded on the OTC Markets after the filing of the Form 25, although it cannot assure that this will be the case.  After the delisting becomes effective, the Company is expected to file a Form 15 with the Commission to suspend the Company's reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

"HOUSTON, July 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Hi-Crush Inc. (NYSE: HCR), (""Hi-Crush"" or the ""Company""), a fully-integrated provider of proppant logistics solutions, today announced it has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with certain noteholders (the ""Noteholders""), collectively owning or controlling approximately 94% of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Company's 9.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 (the ""2026 Notes""). To implement the terms of the Agreement, the Company also announced that it has voluntarily filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The terms of the Agreement provide for a comprehensive restructuring of the Company's balance sheet (the ""Prearranged Plan"") to be implemented through the commencement of Chapter 11 cases. The Prearranged Plan, if implemented, will result in the elimination of approximately $450 million of unsecured note debt and an ongoing reduction in annual interest expense of greater than $43 million. The Prearranged Plan also contemplates the equitization of certain material general unsecured claims against the Company. The Prearranged Plan provides the Company significant additional liquidity and minimizes operational disruptions.   During the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company will continue to operate its business in the normal course without disruption to its vendors, customers, or employees, and will have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations during the restructuring process. Through certain motions filed concurrent with the Chapter 11 cases (the ""First Day Motions""), Hi-Crush estimates that substantially all trade vendors who will have an ongoing business relationship with the Company will be paid for goods and services in the normal course of business without interruption. Working with the Noteholders, the Company expects to complete the Chapter 11 process within 60 to 90 days. In addition, the Company has received commitments from its various pre-petition lenders for $65 million in Debtor-In-Possession and exit financing (the ""DIP/Exit Facilities""), subject to typical and customary terms, which will be used to meet working capital needs during the pendency of the case and long-term capital needs post emergence.  The DIP/Exit Facilities consist of, (i) a $25 million Senior Secured Asset Based Loan from its pre-petition secured lenders that will convert to an exit facility upon the Company's emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, and (ii) a $40 million DIP loan from the participating Noteholders, scheduled to be refinanced to $40 million of new Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the ""New Secured Convertible Notes"") upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. ""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with our various lenders,"" said Mr. Robert E. Rasmus, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hi-Crush. ""The agreement will allow Hi-Crush to maintain normal operations and continue delivering high quality services to our customers.  We will also significantly improve our balance sheet and enhance our Company's financial flexibility over the near and long-term. The exchange of debt for equity is a clear indication of the high confidence our noteholders have in the future of Hi-Crush.  The agreement itself will simplify and accelerate the restructuring process, and we expect to emerge from this process in an even stronger market position, with an enhanced ability to execute on our operational strategy and grow our business over the long-term. We look forward to continuing to work with all of our partners across the oil and gas industry.""  The Prearranged Plan, First Day Motions, and DIP/Exit Facilities are subject to court approval and, as such, final terms of any restructuring transaction may differ.  If approved, they provide for the following: The Company has set up a toll-free hotline to answer questions regarding this transaction. The hotline can be accessed by calling (866) 554-5810. Additional information regarding Hi-Crush Inc.'s restructuring and Chapter 11 filing is available at https://www.ir.hicrush.com/restructuring.

"PALM BEACH, Fla., Nov. 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The world is currently undergoing a harrowing and unprecedented event: the COVID-19 pandemic. During these trying times, gaming has become a means of escapism and time filling for many.  As a result, one of this year's growth drivers is an increased interest in gaming due to COVID-19-related lockdown measures. Recent industry reports and publications estimate that the world's 2.7 billion gamers will spend $159.3 billion on games in 2020 and that the market will surpass $200 billion by 2023. Across all three segments (PC, console, and mobile), almost half of consumer spending on games will come from China and the U.S. in 2020. However, growth will be driven by emerging markets in regions like Latin America and Asia-Pacific in the years to come. According to NewZoo, the total games market is projected to continue to grow in the following years, exceeding $200 billion at the end of 2023. ""By then, we forecast the games market to grow with a +8.3% CAGR to $200.8 billion… Due to the new generation of consoles, growth in console game revenues will steadily grow every year, although we do not foresee revenues reaching double-digit growth before five to six years into the launch. Mobile gaming will continue to be the fastest-growing segment overall.""    Active tech companies in the markets this week include Versus Systems Inc. (CSE: VS) (OTCQB: VRSSF), Zynga Inc. (NASDAQ: ZNGA), GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Unity Software Inc. (NYSE: U), Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATVI).  The NewZoo article reported: ""All game segments saw an increase in engagement and revenues as a result of the COVID-19 measures, but mobile gaming saw the biggest increase. In total, mobile games will generate revenues of $77.2 billion in 2020, growing +13.3% year on year.   There are a few reasons why mobile will enjoy more growth than both PC and console gaming:  Mobile gaming has the lowest barrier to entry: more than two-fifths of the global population owns a smartphone—and many mobile titles are free to play; Mobile gaming as an alternative to PC cafes: the closure of these cafes has led many to (temporarily) churn to mobile gaming; and The mobile development process is less complex and, therefore, less likely to suffer delays from COVID-19-related disruption.""   Versus Systems Inc.

"HOUSTON, Aug. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- FR TNT Holdings LLC and certain of its affiliates (""TNT"" or the ""Company"") announced today that they have entered into a restructuring support agreement (the ""RSA"") with holders of more than 73% in principal amount of the Company's first lien secured loans and 75% in principal amount of its second lien secured loans, along with certain other supporting parties, to execute a transaction that will de-lever and financially strengthen the Company. Through the transaction, TNT will recapitalize and gain new liquidity in the form of a new $225 million term loan provided by the Company's first lien lenders. All operations will continue as usual without interruption. TNT's executive leadership team, which remains focused on the Company's operational performance, is expected to remain in place. The Company is seeking to implement the transaction through a debt-for-equity exchange (the ""Exchange""), which the lenders party to the RSA have agreed to accept. All the Company's first lien and second lien lenders will be solicited for the Exchange. The Exchange will only be consummated with the participation of 100% of the first lien and second lien lenders. Simultaneously with the solicitation of the Exchange, TNT will also solicit votes on a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the ""Prepackaged Plan"") through cases under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which will be commenced in August 2020 in the event the Company is unable to achieve 100% support for the Exchange. This dual-track approach, with significant lender support, will enable TNT to swiftly and definitively recapitalize its balance sheet with no impact to the majority of the Company's stakeholders. All parties to the RSA have already agreed to support the Prepackaged Plan, the terms of which are substantially the same as the Exchange and similarly provide for operations to continue as usual without interruption, with employees, suppliers, vendors, contract counterparties and other trade creditors to be paid in full in the ordinary course. The Company has secured commitments from certain of its first lien lenders for an additional $45 million debtor-in-possession financing, which, in addition to TNT's normal operating cash flows, will help fund the process and ensure the Company is able to operate as usual during the chapter 11 proceedings, if the transaction is implemented through a Prepackaged Plan.  ""This restructuring is a positive outcome that will bolster TNT's financial strength and support our operations for the future. We are grateful to the lead members of our term loan group for working closely with us to prepare the consensual transaction and for the confidence demonstrated by their support. This consensual transaction will position TNT on firm financial footing with a healthier balance sheet. TNT will continue to operate seamlessly with an unwavering focus on safety and customer experience and no impact to our employees, customers and vendors,"" said Michael Appling Jr., Chief Executive Officer of TNT. ""We are looking forward to working with the new ownership group to continue as North America's leader in providing safe, reliable lifting services as we grow alongside our customers."" Solicitation of the Exchange and the Prepackaged Plan is expected to commence imminently.   Through the transaction, the Company's first lien lenders will receive $100 million in exit term loans and 97% of the equity in reorganized TNT (subject to dilution).  The Company's second lien lenders will receive the remaining equity in reorganized TNT and warrants that may be exercised for up to 5% of the equity in reorganized TNT (subject to dilution by a management incentive plan).  All existing secured loans will be retired.  TNT is represented by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor, LLP, as legal co-counsels, Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC and Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., as financial advisor and investment banker, and FTI Consulting, Inc. as financial advisor. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. About TNT TNT is a crane services platform that provides operated and maintained (""O&M"") crane services and comprehensive lifting services to a broad customer base across multiple sites, with a diversified end market exposure.  As a provider of O&M services, the Company supplies its customers with highly skilled operators, technical expertise and project engineering and design in connection with its lifting services.

"WILMINGTON, Del., Dec. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Clingman & Hanger Management Associates, LLC  and Amini LLC today announced the approval of a settlement agreement with the US Department of Education (DOE), clearing the way for a final resolution of the complex bankruptcy of FCC Holdings, Inc.  Prior to its 2014 bankruptcy, FCC operated 41 for-profit schools under the trade names Florida Career Colleges and Anthem Schools.  After the successful resolution of litigation against FCC's directors and officers, creative tax work and Friday, December 4, 2020's approval of a settlement with the DOE, Clingman & Hanger is in position to make a final distribution to FCC's unsecured creditors and close this complex bankruptcy case.   The effect of the DOE's claim at $8 million, when added to the $15 million recovery obtained in 2018 from settling with FCC's directors and officers, as well as monies recouped from tax refunds, will allow the liquidating trust to make an estimated 8.2% distribution to unsecured creditors. The attorneys at Amini LLC have served as litigation counsel to Clingman & Hanger since their appointment in 2015 and handled the D&O litigation as well as the resolution of the DOE's bankruptcy claim.  FCC filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the DOE restricted FCC's ability to draw down Title IV funds based upon alleged improprieties in the company's Title IV program.  Subsequently, the DOE filed a claim for over $37 million in the bankruptcy case.   In March 2015, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a chapter 11 plan for FCC, which placed all of its assets into a liquidating trust and appointed Clingman & Hanger as the liquidating trustee.  At the time, the trust held only a minimal amount of cash to investigate potential recovery actions and complete case administration.    In announcing the US Bankruptcy Court decision, Teresa Hanger, of Clingman & Hanger said, ""We are very excited about The Honorable Christopher S. Sontchi 's approval of our settlement.  Thanks to the efforts and the perseverance of the Amini LLC lawyers, Bijan Amini, Avery Samet, and Lita Beth Wright, who partnered with us from the very beginning to Friday's action, we are finally able to wind down this chapter 11 case, make a final distribution to unsecured creditors, and apply for the final decree. The distribution rate of 8.2% is an unusually high payout for a bankruptcy case that literally had no funds for creditor distributions at plan confirmation.""   ""At the beginning there was very little cash on hand to conduct an investigation.  We had to pursue every possible lead and legal vehicle to identify sources of recovery for FCC's creditors.  It was complicated and arduous, but working together with Clingman & Hanger, we prevailed, and we are very gratified by this final resolution of this very complex bankruptcy case,"" Amini LCC's Avery Samet explained. The D&O LitigationFCC obtained approximately 90% of its revenue from the DOE in Title IV funds paid to satisfy student tuition obligations.  It engaged in pre-drawing federal funds for student loans based on projected student enrollments but was unable to substantiate student eligibility and disbursements for all of the funds it drew.  By early 2014, the DOE warned FCC about the overdraws and in March demanded that FCC submit proof of disbursement of all funds drawn or return any excess, which at that point exceeded $15 million. FCC attempted to raise additional capital to repay the imbalance, but in the meantime the Department of Education revoked FCC's ability to pre-draw. FCC promptly collapsed as it missed payroll, fired its Chief Executive Officer, and uncovered millions of additional funds required to be returned to the DOE. Hemorrhaging cash, cut-off from its ordinary cash flow and incapable of even identifying its ultimate liability to the Title IV program, FCC was forced into a fire sale, obtaining under $4 million for assets previously valued in excess of $150 million. After an initial investigation, the attorneys at Amini LLC, then at Storch Amini PC, commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against certain officers for breaching their fiduciary duties to FCC.  Shortly before the case was ready for trial, they obtained a settlement for $15 million with the defendants.  The Delaware Bankruptcy Court approved that settlement in July 2018. The DOE SettlementNext, Clingman & Hanger engaged the attorneys at Amini to resolve the $37.7 million proof of claim filed by the Department of Education.  The DOE principally sought the disgorgement of $32 million in Pell Grants drawn by FCC during the 2013-2014 school year, on account of FCC's failure to complete a close-out audit.  Clingman & Hanger objected to the government's claim, on the ground that it sought to ""assess … a claim against the Debtor"" in violation of Bankruptcy Code section 362a and because the subject regulations did not give rise to a right to payment as of the petition date of the amounts claimed by the DOE.  They also objected to the portion the claim seeking to recover costs of funds.  Following the filing of the objection, Clingman & Hanger began discussions with the Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the Department of Education, about their respective positions. In early November 2020, the United States Department of Justice agreed, subject to approval of the Court, to allowance of the DOE's Claim in the reduced amount of $8,045,462.78, effectively agreeing to comprise the claim at 9.7% of the disputed portion, and the exchange of mutual releases as provided in the Settlement Agreement, which was approved by the Court. This settlement has increased the distribution rate to unsecured creditors by more than 160%.

WeTrade Group Announces Stock Split",stock-split
"NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Big pharma and life science companies are making big news these days. The drug-development space is seeing strong investor interest as these companies make breakthrough advancements that address vast unmet medical needs. Strategic M&A moves are adding spice to the gumbo for investors as pioneering research remains focused on providing life-changing treatments for those suffering from a myriad of disorders. One of the largest and trickiest medical disorders of mankind may be on the cusp of more effective treatment. Depression is often kept in the dark and not talked about, but it is estimated that more than 17 million adults in the United States experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2019 alone, while one out of every four people in the world struggle with a diagnosable mental disorder. Life sciences company Cybin Inc. (Cybin Profile) is at the vanguard of new therapeutic protocols that target these disorders. Cybin is intent on developing psychedelic therapeutics along with unique delivery mechanisms that target depression as well as other psychiatric and neurological conditions. The company could benefit from two game-changing announcements made in the past few days: the company just completed its previously announced reverse takeover and a groundbreaking study published in JAMA Psychiatry reports that in a recent study a treatment featuring psilocybin actually worked better than typical antidepressant medications. Other drug-development companies are experiencing similar milestone moments. Last month Praxis Precision Medicines Inc. (NASDAQ: PRAX) closed on its upsized initial public offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to Praxis of $218.5 million. Earlier this year, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) completed a transformative acquisition of Allergan. Less than a year ago, Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ: AXSM) realized more than $200 million when it closed on its public offering. And this summer Relmada Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: RLMD) uplisted to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.   Click here to view the custom infographic of the Cybin editorial. Focused on Breakthrough Psilocybin Therapeutics Staggering amounts of big money are moving into the drug-development sector, and Cybin Inc. is seeing its share. The leading life sciences company recently announced that it completed a reverse takeover transaction announced last month; the company also expects to start trading common shares on the NEO exchange as soon as week under the symbol CYBN. According to Cybin, the reverse takeover of Clarmin Explorations Inc. will result in a unique public company. The new company will focus on psychedelic drug development, unique delivery mechanisms, and improved novel compounds and protocols that may finally offer relief to the millions that suffer from depression and other psychiatric or neurological conditions.  ""We are very pleased to have completed the Reverse Takeover and to have received conditional approval to list CYBIN's shares on the NEO Exchange,"" said Cybin CEO Doug Drysdale. ""We anticipate it will help us to enhance our visibility within the investment community and broaden our investor base, with the goal of building long-term shareholder value. It also represents an important step forward in advancing our development plans. We believe in the application of psychedelic therapies and look forward to advancing them and our other product candidates."" In addition, Cybin Inc. previously announced the closing of a private placement offering resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of CDN$45 million. Cybin plans to use the net proceeds from this offering to further develop the company's psychedelic therapies and nutraceutical products, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The offering included participation from several new investors including RA Capital Management, Janus Henderson Investors, Kearny Venture Partners, LifeSci Venture Partners and Bail Capital. Effect 'More than Four Times Greater' In a world where one out of every four people struggle with a diagnosable mental disorder, people are desperately searching for answers. Cybin is working to identify answers and address an enormous unmet medical need. The company is intent on becoming the first life sciences company to bring an effective psilocybin therapeutic drug to market targeting major depressive disorder (MDD), and a recent study may indicate that Cybin's focus is spot on.  Earlier this month, an article in the journal JAMA Psychiatry reported the remarkable findings of a study featuring the hallucinogen psilocybin. During the study, 27 patients received two doses of psilocybin on different days and also received about 11 hours of psychotherapy; half the participants began treatment immediately while the other half began treatment eight weeks later. The research team observed that the treatment had an effect ""more than four times greater"" than the typical antidepressant medications. ""There was a significant reduction in depression in the immediate-treatment group compared to those in the waitlist,"" reported Alan Davis, an author of the study and a faculty member at both Johns Hopkins University and Ohio State University in an NPR article titled ""Rigorous Study Backs a Psychedelic Treatment for Major Depression."" ""The effect happened within one day after the first session and sustained at that reduced level through the second psilocybin session all the way up to the one-month follow-up,"" Davis continued.  ""The study is notable for its scientific rigor,"" said Charles F. Reynolds III, MD, distinguished professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine. ""It offers, I think, a good deal of promise as a feasible approach to treating particularly chronic forms of depression."" Reynolds also observed that the emergence of treatments such as psilocybin may signal a new era in treatments.  At the Vanguard of Research The JAMA report noted that additional research and study on all aspects psilocybin is warranted, and Cybin has already made significant strides. Earlier this year, Cybin entered into a feasibility agreement with IntelGenx Corp. for the development of an orally dissolving film for the delivery of pharmaceutical-grade psilocybin. This could become a groundbreaking advancement not just for the delivery psilocybin therapeutics but also for more effective treatments of mental disorders. ""Compared to oral psilocybin capsules, which are subject to variable intestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism in the liver, the systemic bioavailability of orally dissolving psilocybin film is expected to be quite high,"" said Cybin chief medical officer, Jukka Karjalainen MD. ""Additionally, the dose of psilocybin administered by an orally dissolving film is expected to be a fraction of the requirement in oral capsules. These features have the potential to increase both the safety and efficacy of psilocybin when administered in this manner."" As part of that agreement, Cybin is currently involved in an oral-film bioequivalence study designed to compare molecular delivery of psilocybin through its fast-acting oral films in contrast to capsules. This is just one of the several clinical trials and studies in the company's rapidly growing pipeline.  The Cybin pipeline also includes: Mental disorders have long been misunderstood, attributed to possession by evil or to personal shortcomings comings. Science has debunked the stigmas and revealed that typically a chemical imbalance occurs in the brain. The progress in therapeutics has come a long way from exorcisms and shamans yet millions still suffer. New therapeutics are coming that may well provide relief to the suffering and opportunity to the savvy.  Smart Players Attracting Attention Cybin isn't the only company making headway in this area. Other smart players are seizing opportunities to attract investors and strengthen their position in the space.  Praxis Precision Medicines Inc. (NASDAQ: PRAX) closed on its upsized initial public offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock. The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translates genetic insights into the development of therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by neuronal imbalance.

Axsome's core CNS product candidate portfolio includes four clinical-stage candidates, including one — AXS-05 — that is currently in a phase 3 trial and is being developed for MDD. ""Over the past several months, we continued to advance our AXS-05 and AXS-07 product candidates towards NDA submissions in major depressive disorder and migraine, and intensified our commercial launch readiness activities,"" reported Axsom CEO Herriot Tabuteau, MD. Relmada Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: RLMD) started trading in July 2020 on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. A clinical-stage company developing novel therapies for the treatment of CNS diseases, Relmada has a lead program focused on REL-1017 (dextromethadone), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of depression. NMDA receptor antagonists may have utility in the treatment of a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders associated with a variety of cognitive, neurological and behavioral symptoms.

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAEBITDA consists of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing performance. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a way of evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers and to assess compliance with our credit facilities. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP operating performance measures commonly used in our industry that provide investors and analysts with measures of ongoing operating results, unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. We believe that the supplemental adjustments applied in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.

Our aim with online auctions is to ensure that quality items don't end up in a landfill – but instead allows for sustainable repurposing that not only makes economic sense but will provide a positive outcome for surviving restaurant operators who can benefit from this liquidation.""  Leslie Gladstone, Trustee of the Bankruptcy who also serves as an officer of the National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees, says of the liquidation, ""It is our first and foremost mission with this liquidation to get some return for the creditors of this chain. We also intend to provide a sustainable re-use of the equipment that will make a difference for other restaurants who have been incredibly challenged as a result of the pandemic."" RestaurantEquipment.Bid is a marketplace for furniture, fixtures, small wares and supplies for restaurants. The company, part of TAGeXBrands (www.TAGeXBrands.com), began to relieve restaurant headaches for closures and asset liquidation in the food service industry.  Garden Fresh was founded in 1978 in San Diego, expanding across the US with over 23 locations in Florida. At the time of the bankruptcy there were over 4,400 employees and 97 locations.

Important additional factors include the Company's operational dependency on Seadrill Limited for certain management and technical support services, the Company's ability to successfully complete a reorganization process under Chapter 11, the outcome of which is uncertain, our ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and other third parties as a result of our Chapter 11 filing, our ability to maintain or obtain adequate financing to support our business plans post-emergence from Chapter 11, the length of time that we will operate under Chapter 11 protection; and risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 proceedings that may interfere with the Company's ability to  solicit, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization..

"WAYNE, N.J., Aug. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Villa Victoria Pizzeria and the attorneys at Scura, Wigfield, Heyer, Stevens & Cammarota LLP have had the first ever Chapter 11 Subchapter V Bankruptcy filing approved by US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Jersey. This is the first approved plan of small business reorganization under the new Subchapter V Bankruptcy Code in the District of New Jersey and may be the first in the nation. This is a massive game-changer in the field of bankruptcy law. Villa Victoria, also known by their legal name Nizza, Inc., is a full-service pizzeria located at 11 Park Avenue in Montclair, New Jersey. It is the quintessential New Jersey pizzeria. Prior to the mandated COVID-19 restrictions, Villa Victoria provided on-premises dining, pick-up and delivery services, and event catering. It has since adapted to the changing times with delivery, curbside pick-up, and outdoor dining. Nizza, Inc's current management stepped in after the prior managerial team failed to remit tax payments to the State of New Jersey and thus started to fall behind with vendors. The business always had a loyal clientele thanks to its great food and prime location in downtown Montclair. However, it struggled to bring its delinquent tax debt current and began falling behind on payments to its landlord. The business was close to losing everything – until they contacted their legal team at Scura to help them with keeping the wolves at bay. They needed relief that only bankruptcy protection can provide. The day they filed for bankruptcy, March 10th, the New Jersey Division of Taxation had revenue agents inside the building trying to lock the doors forever. They had come to shut this local landmark down. Filing for bankruptcy saved the company at the literal last second. The Scura team informed the agents that the bankruptcy stay was in effect and the agents picked up their files and sent the locksmith away. Now Villa Victoria and its attorneys had to form a plan for how it would emerge from bankruptcy. Nizza, Inc. is one of the first small businesses to file the Small Business Reorganization Act (SBRA), first approved in February 2020. As the name suggests, this simplified process for bankruptcy is designed for small businesses to reorganize following financial hardships. The SBRA is codified at 11 U.S.C. § 1181 – 11 U.S.C. § 1195, otherwise known as Subchapter V. The SBRA is a voluntary option for small businesses, with many advantages over pre-existing options available to small businesses, including ""small business debtors"" under the Bankruptcy Code pre-SBRA. Villa Victoria was one of the first small businesses to use the new law but since then Scura has been very busy helping numerous other businesses get the help they need. On August 11th , Villa Victoria became the first Subchapter V case approved by the Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey and one of the first in the nation. The approved bankruptcy plan promises to pay all creditors in full and allows outstanding tax obligations to be repaid over years. The landlord will also be repaid the delinquent rent but will have to except monthly payments over the next year. Villa Victoria has made it through the most difficult of times and now has taken the right steps to progress to a brighter, more financially sound future. That news is fortunate for Villa Victoria and the family that held it together, as well as for those in Montclair able to drop by for a slice of pie. Scura, Wigfield, Heyer, Stevens & Cammarota LLP is a Bankruptcy and Personal Injury Law Firm working in New Jersey. Our team handles all types of bankruptcy, personal injury, estate planning, real estate law and litigation cases. We are ready to journey with you towards resolution and ensure that you get the best legal representation available in New Jersey. This press release was issued through 24-7PressRelease.com.

"HONG KONG, Oct. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of SEII announces that a 1-50 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock has been effected. Every fifty issued existing shares has been consolidated into one share, effective from 13 October 2020.  The SEII's board of directors considers that the primary driver behind the share consolidation is that it will result in an upward adjustment to the share price of the company. The board is aware that certain brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit them from investing in low-priced shares or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending low-priced shares to their customers.  The board believes that the higher trading price of the new shares will also enhance the company's corporate image and therefore attract a broader range of institutional and professional investors to invest in the new shares, broadening the shareholder base of the company. This has multiple benefits for the company and its existing shareholders. More financing opportunities may become available for the company if the new shares become an acceptable investment option for institutional investors. This would allow the company to pursue additional profit-generating ventures to support the company's long term development. Greater investment by institutional investors, if the company can attract such investors, is also likely to reduce the volatility of and stabilize the price of shares of the company, as such investors tend to have longer investment horizons.  It is anticipated that a more stable and less volatile trading share price will serve to facilitate trading activities and improve market efficiency by boosting the liquidity of the new shares.

The Prepackaged Plan has the support of holders of 98.6% in principal amount of the Company's first lien secured loans and 93.8% in principal amount of its second lien secured loans. Execution of the Prepackaged Plan will enable the Company to quickly and efficiently recapitalize its balance sheet with no impact to the majority of its stakeholders. TNT expects to emerge from chapter 11 proceedings within 55 days with a stronger capital structure. The Company has also secured commitments from certain of its first lien lenders for an additional $45 million debtor-in-possession financing, which, in addition to TNT's normal operating cash flows, will help fund the process and ensure the Company is able to operate as usual during the chapter 11 proceedings. Upon emergence, TNT will recapitalize and gain new liquidity in the form of a new $225 million term loan provided by the Company's first lien lenders. Today's filing only includes TNT and Southway. Importantly, all the Company's businesses, whether included in the filing or not, are operating as usual and are expected to do so throughout this process. ""For the past few years, TNT has been seeking a long-term solution that improves our capital structure in order to build a stronger and more successful financial future. This consensual transaction represents the opportunity to accomplish just that,"" said Michael Appling Jr., Chief Executive Officer of TNT.

Appling continued, ""This transaction builds upon the strategies we have already implemented to protect our balance sheet and counter the challenging and unprecedented business environment to ensure we can continue to deliver upon our commitments to our stakeholders. I want to thank our talented team for their focus and commitment to safety — now and always. We are looking forward to emerging from this process and continuing our work as North America's leader in providing safe, reliable lifting services.""

In addition, the Company is seeking Court approval of a motion that provides for payment of all trade creditors in full for goods and services delivered prior to the filing. These motions are typical in a chapter 11 process and will be heard in the first few days of the case. Once approved, they will allow operations to continue as usual without interruption, with employees, suppliers, vendors, contract counterparties and other trade creditors to be paid in full in the ordinary course of business.

About Exro Technologies Inc. Exro is a Clean Tech company that has developed a new class of control technology for electric powertrains. Exro's advanced motor control technology, the ""Coil Driver"", expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains. The Coil Driver enables two separate torque profiles within a given motor. The first is calibrated for low speed and high torque, while the second provides expanded operation at high speed. The ability to change configuration allows efficiency optimization for each operating mode, resulting in overall reductions in energy consumption. The controller automatically and seamlessly selects the appropriate configuration in real time so that torque demand and efficiency are optimized. The limitations of traditional electric machines and power technology are becoming more evident. In many increasingly prominent applications, traditional methods cannot meet the required performance. This means either oversizing the equipment, adding additional motors, or implementing heavy mechanical geared solutions.
